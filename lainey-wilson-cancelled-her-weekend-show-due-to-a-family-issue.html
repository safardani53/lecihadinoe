The Things a Man Oughta Know singer revealed in a statement that she had to cancel due to a family situation. She said in the post:</p><p>“I will be unable to perform in this weekend’s gigs in Maquoketa, Iowa, and Arnold Park, Iowa. I apologize for canceling at the last minute, but please know that I would not cancel if the situation was not important. Please keep my family in your thoughts and prayers.”</p><p>Wilson’s first post made no mention of the family situation. Just hours later, she shared a photo of herself with her father and asked her fans to pray for him. The caption stated:</p><p>“My father [sic]. That’s my cowboy. Please continue to pray for him.”</p><p>She went on to describe her father as the hardest person she knows. The tweet said that her father, Brian Wilson, a farmer in Louisiana, was having a medical issue. However, the nature and scope of the situation are unknown.</p><h2>Lainey Wilson’s father-daughter connection</h2><p>Lainey Wilson (30) has lauded her parents, particularly her father, in previous interviews. Her father has been attributed to much of her work ethic and achievement. Wilson told PEOPLE about her childhood growing up on her father’s farm in Louisiana in an early 2021 interview. She stated:</p><p>“Growing up in this manner taught me so much. I realized from an early age that nothing comes easily.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lainey-Wilson-1.jpg alt="Lainey Wilson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On Father’s Day last month, Lainey Wilson paid homage to her father with a video uploaded on her Instagram page. In the caption, she commended her father for teaching her how to roll her “sleeves up and (to) get it done.”&nbsp;Wilson’s mother remains unknown to the general public.</p><h2>Lainey Wilson, the star of Yellowstone, is a country singer-songwriter.</h2><p>Wilson relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, after graduating from high school. She used to live in her camper trailer, which her father assisted her in purchasing. Earlier this year, the 30-year-old told the online magazine Taste of Country:</p><p>“When I relocated to Nashville in 2011, (my parents) assisted me in purchasing a camper trailer.”</p><p>Wilson released her self-titled studio album in 2014, after doing a few tiny performances for almost two years. Two years later, she released her second studio album, Stronger, which reached 44th on the US Top Country Albums chart (Billboard).&nbsp;Lainey Wilson struck a contract with SONY/ATV in 2018, giving them the right to publish her new tracks at the moment. That same year, she signed with the BBR Music Group record label. She earned two Academy of Country Music Awards last year for “New Female Artist of the Year” and “Song of the Year” for her song “Things a Man Oughta Know.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lainey-Wilson-2.jpg alt="Lainey Wilson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wilson, meantime, announced last month that she had been cast in the forthcoming season of Paramount’s Yellowstone. Wilson will apparently portray a character called Abby in the fifth season, according to her IMDb biography. The episode will be available on November 13th. However, it is unclear if her character will appear again in the series.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmqGemsZuw8ilqqimXZiur6%2FEpaOenF2dsrN51p6cpJ2emXq0tM6wZJ2tlWLBsHnAZp2apZmhxm610qysnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
