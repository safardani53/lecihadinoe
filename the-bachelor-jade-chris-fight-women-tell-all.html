It was right after hometown dates, when her brothers told Chris she was a “wild mustang,” and she broke the news to Chris about her&nbsp;Playboy past.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>She revealed that she was extremely hurt after reading in his&nbsp;PEOPLE blog that he was “disturbed” by her family date, and after leaving Jade’s place, he told the cameras&nbsp;he felt “awkward” looking at her naked pics — <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>after telling her he was fine</a>. It made her question whether or not he really did send her home because of her pictures. Here’s his exact quote from the blog.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>I was intrigued by what her family was saying, but almost disturbed by the fact that the Jade I knew was so different from what they were describing. I was also a bit disturbed by her brother Zach’s concern about Jade’s willingness to move back to a small town.</p><h3>Chris Tries & Fails At An Explanation</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>So, what did&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;have to say? Well, not much. He said he should have used “caught off guard” instead of&nbsp;“disturbed.” Well, news flash Chris, there’s this thing called proofreading that you do on a blog. It’s not like live TV, where you can’t rewrite it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for the word “awkward,” he again said it was probably a poor word choice. Well, it&nbsp;was awkward, we get it — but in Jade’s mind, she wanted him to be honest in the original moment, not act fine then backtrack.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jade also agreed. A fan tweeted at her during the episode:</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>.<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@Steccofcards</a> me too</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>— Jade Elizabeth Roper (@jadelizroper) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 3, 2015</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>So, what did you guys think?
