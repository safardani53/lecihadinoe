Could not do much about either of Blades' goals.</p><h2>VICTOR LINDELOF - 4</h2><p>Did not cover himself in glory along with his other defensive colleagues.</p><p>Will escape much of the criticism as <a href=#>Phil Jones</a> on the other side of the three was so so so much worse.</p><h2>HARRY MAGUIRE - 5</h2><p>As captain against his old team, he spent the entire first-half moaning at his teammates. Hardly inspiring on a worrying night for United.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542515525-e1574621636894.jpg><h2>PHIL JONES - 2</h2><p>Woeful. First Premier League start of the season and most <a href=#>United</a> fans will hope it is his last.</p><p>Bullied off the ball by Mousset for Blades opener on 20 minutes and lost his head with needless fouls and awful positioning for the rest of the half.</p><p>Hauled off at half-time and it's a surprise it took that long.</p><h2>AARON WAN-BISSAKA - 5</h2><p>Sheffield United mostly attacked down the opposite flank so was not called on too much.</p><p>But looked ineffective going forward which - when playing as a wing-back in the five at the back formation - will disappoint his manager.</p><h2>BRANDON WILLIAMS - 4</h2><p>Dominated by George Baldock down Sheffield United's right in the first half.</p><p>Booked early in the second-half for foul on brilliant Baldock again.</p><p>Looked out of his depth.</p><p>Wonderful strike in the second-half sparked United's comeback but was the only positive.</p><h2>FRED - 4</h2><p>Once again left everyone wondering how such a player is starting in centre-midfield for Man Utd.</p><p>Outplayed by every one of the Blades's midfielders.</p><h2>ANDREAS PEREIRA - 5</h2><p>Ok. Ran around a bit. Better than Fred - just.</p><p>Replaced by Greenwood who immediately scored.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542524352-e1574621722551.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542521906-e1574621810622.jpg><h2>DAN JAMES - 8</h2><p>Was the most industrious of United's attacking players but that's not saying much.</p><p>Counter attacked with pace on a couple of occasions but very little end product early on.</p><p>Played key role in United's flurry of goals in the second-half - bagged assist for Rashford.</p><h2>ANTHONY MARTIAL - 4</h2><p>Absolutely invisible for the entire game other than a speculative effort from 30 yards on the hour mark.</p><p>Not helped by non-existent service from his team-mates but still.</p><h2>MARCUS RASHFORD - 7</h2><p>Lacklustre apart from the crazy ten minute spell from 70 minutes.</p><p>As one of United's highest earners, he was threatening to disappoint in game he should have been grabbing by the scruff of the neck.</p><p>Came alive out of nowhere to save his reputation tonight.</p><p>Delightful ball for Greenwood's equaliser and then couldn't miss United's third after James had put it on a plate for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542519783-1.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FOOTBALL</h2></p><h2>JESSE LINGARD (on for Jones, 45) - 6</h2><p>Tried to make things happen. Was far from the worst man in a black shirt tonight.</p><h2>MASON GREENWOOOD (on for Pereira, 73) - 8</h2><p>Fantastic instant impact. Scored the equaliser just moments after coming on. Looked hungry as his team chased an undeserved win.</p><h2>AXEL TUANZEBE (on for Martial, 85) - 5</h2><p>Did not have much time to make an impact. Was brought on to firm things up but McBurnie bagged equaliser soon after his introduction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000542521733-1.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>JoseÃÅ Mourinho delighted loud music is pumping once more in the Spurs dressing room</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2Z9dX2Sb2lsZ52Wu27B051kq5mknruov4ypn6KkXZ%2B8r7HSZpuapl2frq6x0mZqZmtdqLWmssWinKWcXaq7qsDEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
