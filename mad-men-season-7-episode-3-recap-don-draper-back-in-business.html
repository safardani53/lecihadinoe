Megan asks with fully justified suspicion. "I know what you’re like when you’re left alone."</p><p>"There is no one else," Don replies. "I haven’t even been drinking that much."</p><p>And for once, he’s being honest. Don was once a man defined by work, women and whiskey. Seeing him stripped of his vices and his vocation, we’re as confused as Megan as to what’s driving him these days.</p><p>Fortunately for Don, his work comeback goes slightly than his failed reconciliation with Megan…though it certainly doesn’t come easy.</p><p>To say Don’s return to SC & P creates a stir would be like saying <a href=#>Jon Hamm’s penis</a> occasionally draws attention.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole office is taken by surprise, with the exception of Roger, who doesn’t help Don’s case by strolling in late after a three-martini lunch.</p><p>When it comes down to an emergency partners’ meeting, however, Roger makes up for years of drunken half-assing by passionately defending Don’s stake in the firm.&nbsp;</p><p>And with that, the ultimate ad men is back where he belongs…with a whole slew of conditions.</p><p><strong>Meanwhile:</strong></p><p>It looks like we can add Peggy to the list of former sharks who are now treading water.</p><p>Not only will she not be getting the Clio award she had her heart set on, Stan and Ginsberg have been nominated for their work on her account. No wonder she’s pissed to see Don come back. She’s got enough dudes thwarting her ambition!</p><p>Speaking of the forgotten ladies in Don’s life – Betty’s back! Her idea of ambition apparently involves going on her son’s third grade field trip, but at least she’s slimmed down and getting out of the house!</p><p>Of course, it only takes one incident involving a sandwich and two 8-year-olds to return Betty to her natural state of horrible human being.</p><p>Worse: her conversation with little Bobby Draper is more than upsetting – his love of the Wolfman&nbsp;suggests he shares his dad’s obsession with transformation. That should work out well!</p><p><a href=#>Watch Mad Men online</a> at TV Fanatic to relive Betty’s transformation from doting wife to psycho blonde b-word.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>9 Memorable Mad Men Moments</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2WBcLnAnWSmnZ5iwKat0qilZm9dmr2qv86dnGZrXaeypK3PZpuopl2Zv6K8xKtkm5mToHqquoybrKyhnprAtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
