The whole f–king city sees it! Don’t do this.”</p><p>In response, Travis reposted a message from @courtneyluxe, who claimed she’s “been working with travis for 8 years” and “was on set all day as he was directing a video for another artist.”</p><p>The woman claimed Kar “was not there with him” and called Rojean “delusional.”</p><p>“He does not fck with her in any way.
