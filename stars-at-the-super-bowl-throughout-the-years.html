While watching the showdown between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons with husband <a href=#><strong>John Legend</strong></a>, the model’s nipple <a href=#>was briefly exposed in footage</a> from the sporting event.</p><p>The cookbook author, for her part, <a href=#>took the situation in stride, tweeting a video of the moment</a> that same month. “Boom goes the dynamite,” Teigen — who <a href=#>shares daughters Luna and Esti and son Miles</a> with the “All of Me” singer — wrote at the time.</p><p>Over the years, Teigen continued to share insight into her family’s love for the Super Bowl. In February 2022, the Utah native revealed <a href=#>she was rooting for the Cincinnati Bengals as a favor for her husband</a>.</p><p>“Update: she committed,” she captioned an Instagram photo of her and the musician in front of a large balloon display of Bengals colors.</p><p>Teigen previously noted that <a href=#>she was on the fence about which team to cheer for</a>, writing via Instagram, “I dunno who I’m rooting for but I do love an underdog and the mister issss from Ohio but my home is LA! The winner today will be all of us, for it is a beautiful day for good friends and a good game. how’s that for neutral! go sports!!”</p><p>She continued: “I love the passion, the friends, the food, the commercials, halftime, the silly bets like what color liquid will be dumped on the winning coach.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>, for her part, shared a different look at attending the Super Bowl when she filmed <a href=#>her experience performing at the 2020 halftime show</a>. In her June 2022 documentary about the headline-making performance, the Hustlers actress <a href=#>revealed that she struggled being a co-headliner</a> with <a href=#><strong>Shakira</strong></a>.</p><p>“We have six f—king minutes. We have 30 seconds of a song, and if we take a minute, that’s it, we’ve got five left. But there’s got to be certain songs that we sing, though. We have to have our singing moments. It’s not going to be a dance f—king revue,” she explained in the doc. “We have to sing our message. … This is the worst idea in the world to have two people do the Super Bowl. It was the worst idea in the world.”</p><p>Viewers also <a href=#>got to see Lopez and Shakira’s collaboration process</a> ahead of their big performance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They said 12 minutes. I got kind of a good confirmation that we could have an extra minute or two, so now we’re at, like, 13, 14 minutes,” the Marry Me star detailed at the time. “I think, Shakira, what we should have is you should have half the time and I should [have half]. If it was going to be a double headliner, they should have given us 20 minutes. That’s what they should’ve f—king done.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more pics of celebrities getting into the game:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowaK%2B0maYrWWknbJuv9SpnKtlkqTErXnToamorZedvLbAjK2fnmWpmq6zv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
