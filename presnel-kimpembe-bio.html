Also, he is the son of a Congolese father and a Haitian mother.</p><p>As a default, Kimpembe can hold Congo DR citizenship as well. Added to that, the defender grew up alongside his siblings, <strong>Kevin,</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Black</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Kitoka Kimpembe.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Presnel-Kimpembe-Young-Age-239x300.jpg><p>In the same way, the French-born started playing at age 7 for a club named AS Eragny. After three years at the local club, PSG scouted Presnel in 2005.</p><p>The Ligue 1 club placed him at their youth academy to hone his defensive attributes. Subsequently, Presnel received a promotion to PSG B-team and started playing professionally in 2013.</p><h2>Presnel Kimpembe | Age, Height, & Body Statistics</h2><p>The French international is 25 years old at present. Also, Presnel stands at the height of 6’2″ (1.88 m), which is a minimum height criterion for a defender.</p><p>A defender should generally be tall. Similarly, the Frenchman has a fabulous physique and hence is nearly indomitable during duels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/presnel-555.jpg><p>However, all defenders need not be tall. If you look at, for instance, the ex-Italian captain <strong>Fabio Cannavaro,</strong> he wasn’t tall, but his technical ability surpassed most of his fellow defenders at that time.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Lewandowski Bio: Age, Height, Stats, Club, Career, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Although Kimpembe has a lot to learn, we can assume with a muscular physique; he will soon possess adequate mental and defensive skills soon.</p><p>Further, Presnel is a young athlete, and to keep being a valuable asset to his club, the Frenchman opts for a healthy diet and intense workout regime, and training sessions to be fit for play.</p><h2>Presnel Kimpembe | Career & Transfer: Club-level & International</h2><p>Why has the French giant PSG signed Kimpembe? What did they see in him? With many players retiring and the current defensive duo <strong>Marquinhos</strong> and <strong>Thiago Silva</strong> getting older, the club needs to plan for the future.</p><p>With incredible height, young age, and the potential to learn and improve more, Presnel is a valuable asset and a great replacement for Captain Silva or Marquinhos.</p><p>It is quite challenging to be a starter ahead of experienced players until and unless injury strikes them.</p><p>But, Presnel helmed the defensive role as a starter in many instances, specifically, the Champions League, one of the biggest competitions in Europe.</p><p>Presnel initially started from AS Eragny, a club located in the suburbs of Paris. It is there where he first learned how to operate as a defender. Proper defending is always a difficult task.</p><p>Anyone can push opposition and dispossesses them. But to dispossess an opponent without drawing a foul and at the same time being a force that sets up an attack is far more critical.</p><p>There are many traits required to be a defender. Some of them are composure, strength, pace, and ball control. Most importantly, marking, tackling and interception are primary skills expected in a defender.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>The video below</a></strong> shows exactly why Kimpembe is of dire importance for a club of PSG stature.</p><p>In October of the year 2014, Presnel debuted for the Parisian giants against RC Lens as a substitute for <strong>Thiago Motta.</strong> Thereafter, he was a vital part of the team.</p><p>Although not guaranteed a starting spot every game, it is of utmost surety that PSG will not let the French man slide away to a different club.</p><p>Moreover, the center-back officially played a Champions League game on February 14, 2017.</p><p>Likewise, he managed to help the goalkeeper keep a clean sheet in a 4-0 win against the Spanish giants and CL contenders Barcelona. He&nbsp;scored a goal against the English club, Manchester United, winning the game 2-0.</p><p>However, in Paris’s return leg, Kimpembe jumped to block a shot in injury time given as a penalty for handball after the referee consulted VAR.</p><p>PSG went on to lose the match 3–1 and was knocked out due to the away goals rule.</p><p>On 11 July 2020, Presnel signed a contract extension with PSG, with the deal lasting until 2024. At present, Kimpembe occasionally starts for PSG, and his performance is always praiseworthy.</p><p>Give the man 3-4 years, and he will develop into a great defender within that period. The young defender still has hopes to challenge for the CL trophy after a few unsuccessful tries.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>After the withdrawal of Eliaquim Mangala during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, France national coach <strong>Didier Deschamps</strong> listed Presnel in the roster. It was his first international call-up, which indeed was a proud moment for the French.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/presnel-557.jpg><p>Eventually, the center-back had the opportunity to start for France in a friendly against Russia, and after impressing Deschamps, the PSG man is now an international regular.</p><p>Ultimately, with France, Kimpembe won the World Cup, becoming one of the youngest players in the squad alongside Bayern Munich’s <a href=#><strong>Benjamin Pavard</strong></a> and <strong>Lucas Hernandez.</strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Check out this video</a></strong> of Presnel making a tackle of the century in a three-on-one counter vs. Lille.</p><h3>Career Achievements</h3><p>For Club,</p><p>Trophée des Champions:&nbsp;2016/2017</p><p>Coupe de la Ligue:&nbsp;2015/16,&nbsp;2016/17,&nbsp;2017/18</p><p>Coupe de France:&nbsp;2015/16,&nbsp;2016/17</p><p>Ligue 1:&nbsp;2015/16,&nbsp;2017/18,&nbsp;2018/19</p><p>For Country,</p><p>FIFA World Cup:&nbsp;2018</p><p>Other honors include the Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur in 2018, awarded for achieving excellence in a specific field.</p><h2>Career Stats</h2><table width=712><tbody><tr><td rowspan=2><strong>Club</strong></td><td rowspan=2><strong>Season</strong></td><td colspan=3><strong>League</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>National Cup</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>League Cup</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>Continental</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Division</strong></td><td><strong>Apps</strong></td><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td><strong>Apps</strong></td><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td><strong>Apps</strong></td><td><strong>Goals</strong></td><td><strong>Apps</strong></td><td><strong>Goals</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=5>Paris Saint-Germain B</td><td>2013-2014</td><td>CFA</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td></tr><tr><td>2014-2015</td><td>CFA</td><td>23</td><td>0</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2016</td><td>CFA</td><td>13</td><td>1</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td></tr><tr><td>2016-2017</td><td>CFA</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td colspan=2>—</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>41</strong></td><td><strong>1</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>—</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>—</strong></td><td colspan=2><strong>—</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=8>Paris Saint-Germain</td><td>2014-2015</td><td>Ligue 1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2015-2016</td><td>Ligue 1</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2016-2017</td><td>Ligue 1</td><td>19</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2017-2018</td><td>Ligue 1</td><td>28</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2018-2019</td><td>Ligue 1</td><td>24</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>2019-2020</td><td>Ligue 1</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2020-2021</td><td>Ligue 1</td><td>21</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td colspan=2>—</td><td>7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>115</strong></td><td><strong>0</strong></td><td><strong>13</strong></td><td><strong>0</strong></td><td><strong>10</strong></td><td><strong>0</strong></td><td><strong>29</strong></td><td><strong>1</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><strong>Career total</strong></td><td><strong>156</strong></td><td><strong>1</strong></td><td><strong>13</strong></td><td><strong>0</strong></td><td><strong>10</strong></td><td><strong>0</strong></td><td><strong>29</strong></td><td><strong>1</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>How much is Presnel Kimpembe worth?&nbsp;Networth & Transfer Market Value</h2><p>Presnel Kimpembe is highly notable in football, firstly because he plays for one of the biggest, not to mention the wealthiest club in the world.</p><p>Secondly, the defender made it into the French squad for their 2018 World Cup campaign.
