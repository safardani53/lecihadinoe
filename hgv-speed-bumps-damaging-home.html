There was a <a href=#>car upside down</a> here five or six years ago."</p><p>On nearby Old Church Road a team of activists launched a petition to instead&nbsp;<a href=#>reduce the size of the bumps</a>.</p><p>They claim the impact of busses, lorries and HGVs travelling over the top and crashing down the other side has also caused <a href=#>cracks in their homes</a> and makes their ornaments shake.</p><p>Shanta Prasad, who lives on the road, told <a href=#>The Telegraph</a> as soon as the bumps were installed two years ago her "our houses started to shake".</p><p>She added: "I can’t sleep at night. I’ve been referred to the insomnia clinic. Sometimes all I want to do is cry.”</p><p>The issues have become such a problem that <a href=#>Sir Iain Duncan Smith</a>, the MP for Chingford, raised it in Parliament last Tuesday.</p><p>He said: “I have talked to residents who are genuinely deeply stressed by what has happened since heavy speed bumps have been put in place in <a href=#>20mph or even higher speed zones</a>."</p><p>Highways regulations say bumps should be no less than 25mm high and no more than 100mm - forcing cars to drive 5mph to avoid damage.</p><p>A bus comes through Old Church Road every six to nine minutes during the day, starting at 4.46am while a night bus also uses the street.</p><p>Larry Relfe, 75, has lived on the road for decades.</p><p>He told The Sun: "These <a href=#>people's houses, they literally shake</a>. We can feel that a bit when you get an HGV come along.</p><p>"One neighbour says their ornaments shake."</p><p>He says the bumps are also damaging busses and fears the long term cost of damage to public transport will outweigh the saving initiative&nbsp;of installing bumps instead of <a href=#>speed cameras</a>.</p><p>Back on Endlebury Road, Tony Hall, who arrived in June 1971, wants more weight restrictions to bring an end&nbsp;to the "juggernaut" vehicles that chug through daily.</p><p>The 77-year-old said he's got minor cracks in his house and thinks it could be linked to the traffic.</p><p>Cllr Clyde Loakes, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Climate and Air Quality for Waltham Forest Council, said: “The safety of all road users is a top priority. Waltham Forest Council has been implementing a 20mph speed limit across the borough for over 30 years in response to requests from residents and localised consultations.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“We are not permitted by law to use cameras to enforce the speed limit. Earlier this year the Government blocked Wandsworth Council’s trial scheme of using cameras to issue fines for speeding. This leaves speedbumps as the only enforcement method available to councils.</p><p>Multiple studies have found road humps are unlikely to cause significant damage to buildings. We do know for sure that vehicles travelling at speed cause significant damage to people<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>We also know our measures are working - the number of people killed and seriously injured on the borough’s roads has fallen from 97 in 2018 to 70 in 2022.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/residents-london-borough-waltham-forest-865643969.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/residents-london-borough-waltham-forest-865643868.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/residents-london-borough-waltham-forest-865643873.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JxfpFqbG9nmJzDbr%2FPnpydZZKqurG%2FjJ2YppmXnruoeceopJ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
