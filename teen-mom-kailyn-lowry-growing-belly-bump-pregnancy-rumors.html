She will be the mom of 7. You’re welcome."</p><p>But Kailyn&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly denied the rumors, like she did with her pregnancy with Rio, in a TikTok video</a>&nbsp;with Elijah, who she <a href=#>began dating in 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the six-second clip, Kailyn lip-synced to a quote about rumors, saying: "Ever heard a rumor about yourself and actually wanted to hear more? Like, 'damn, what did I do next?'"&nbsp;</p><p>Fans also started&nbsp;to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">notice a change in Kailyn’s appearance</a>, as she had a swollen nose, which is a sign of pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p>One fan commented regarding her appearance: "She's preggo for sure you can see it all in the face.”</p><p>A second agreed: "Her nose always gives it away."</p><p>A third said: "And that face is spreading love like it does every time she’s pregnant!”</p><p>A fourth agreed: "Why deny the pregnancy? Her face tells on her every single time."</p><p>The MTV alum also appeared to show off her supposed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">baby bump</a>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on vacation</a>&nbsp;in Cancun, Mexico over the summer.</p><p>She has also refrained from posting full-body shots in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p><h2>SECRET BIRTH</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pregnancy speculation for her fifth son Rio began in July 2022</a>&nbsp;when Kailyn’s ex Chris, whom she has a tumultuous co-parenting relationship with, tweeted: "Out here talking bout you'll beat me up now you know you gotta protect the belly stop it."</p><p>In that same month, The U.S. Sun obtained pictures of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kailyn looking tense outside of her Delaware home</a>&nbsp;with Elijah.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans claimed to have spotted a bump in the photos, as one commenter posted on Reddit: "Oh My God, Kailyn pics! Is she pregnant?"</p><p>Then in September, The U.S. Sun obtained more unedited images of the star&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with an apparent bump leaving a Wawa</a>&nbsp;convenience store in Delaware.&nbsp;</p><p>A month later, Kailyn was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">photographed running errands</a>&nbsp;at Target and Hobby Lobby with her boyfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>In the photos, Kailyn wore a baggy graphic T-shirt with black leggings, as she covered her stomach with the oversized top.&nbsp;</p><p>In November, fans noticed a bump during the star’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">late-night Wawa run with</a>&nbsp;Lux in photos obtained by The U.S. Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>One fan&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Reddit</a>: "Kailyn spotted out! Looks like a bump to me.”</p><p>A second said: "I’m about 90% sure she’s pregnant.”</p><p>A third remarked: "She’s definitely pregnant. Anyone trying to pretend like she isn’t is just fooling themselves."</p><p>Then in January, after The U.S. Sun's insider claimed she gave birth, Kailyn&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to have lost weight</a>, as she showed off a slimmed-down figure.&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. Sun revealed photos of the podcast host <a href=#>wearing a loose-fitting graphic T-shirt with black pants</a> and sneakers for an outing.&nbsp;</p><h2>SOCIAL MEDIA CLUES</h2><p>Throughout the supposed pregnancy, Kailyn&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posted photos on social media either cutting off or covering up her stomach</a>.</p><p>When Kailyn did share full-body images, she wore&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">baggy hoodies and shirts</a>.</p><p>For the last two weeks of November, Kailyn took off from her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baby Mamas No Drama</a>&nbsp;podcast, as fans speculated she could be on maternity leave.</p><p>Just over a week after the source revealed she gave birth, fans were convinced they could hear&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the sound of a newborn baby</a>&nbsp;in the background of one of her social media videos.</p><p>Also in December, fans&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">noticed what looked like a baby car seat</a>&nbsp;in the back of her video.</p><p>Then, Chris went off on his baby mama in another heated rant on Instagram that read: “You claim to be so real so raw but yet you got a whole newborn you should be focused on and yet you're trying to create unnecessary drama to cover up that FACT.”</p><p>In July, Kailyn finally&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed she welcomed her fifth child</a>&nbsp;despite denying the pregnancy.</p><p>Kailyn told The Culpo Sisters star Aurora Culpo on her podcast Baby Mamas No Drama that she watched her series when she was in the hospital giving birth.</p><p>She said: "I first came across your show... I was in the hospital having one of my kids. The first episode that I saw was, I believe, you told your parents that you were, maybe, separating or divorcing and then one of your sisters was going to watch your kids.”</p><p>The Culpo Sisters premiered in November 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Kailyn quit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teen Mom 2</a>&nbsp;in 2022&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">after 11 years</a>&nbsp;on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>She has focused on her podcast company and currently hosts Coffee Convos, Baby Mamas No Drama, and Barely Famous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/shot-us-sun-exclusive-kailyn-843180443-8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/shot-us-sun-exclusive-kailyn-820271713.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/mom-mess-teen-mom-kailyn-831756178-8.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxYW6CdH2SaKuenZ5iurC5jKSYoqSpo3qtu9arsGafoqTEqrrGZpmepJyueqPBzKlkqaqVnLuiusKyZKutnaS%2FtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
