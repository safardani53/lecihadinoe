I’ll be stocking up on the Cozmo for sure.</p><p>''They smell UNREAL.''</p><p>Hundreds of social media users raced to comments, where many tagged their pals and family to let them know about the bargain deals.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>One exclaimed in joy: ''Omg I didn’t even see these amazing!!
