I am so proud to have been part of that movie and to have known the great Robin Williams,” Bronson wrote.</p><p><a href=#>As previously reported,</a> Williams was found dead at age 63 in his Tiburon, California, home on August 11, 2014. Three months later, it was confirmed that his cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging.</p><p>Bronsan opened up about Williams’ death at the time. “It is a deeply sad time for us all on the loss of Robin Williams. My first day on set, they said, ‘Do you want to meet Robin?’ I had never met the man, I was so excited. I was so thrilled to have this job in the company of this great star comedian,” <a href=#>he told <i>Us Weekly </i>in a statement.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>“I walked into the trailer and there was Robin in a pair of Ugg boots, hairy legs, shorts, Hawaiian shirt and hairy chest. That’s how I met Robin Williams, and that’s how I met Mrs. Doubtfire. And I had the time of my life.”</p><p>He continued. “Every day was just sheer magic with the man. His hilarity, his grace, his brilliance of mind and soul. His reverence, sincerity. [It’s a] deep loss.”</p><p>After his death, Williams was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia.&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapoZWnsKZ5waump6ufo3qxsc2sZK2npZi1qrrGZquroZKqwaZ506hkq6eSnrtuw8ilo6KZnah6uICYbnBwcF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
