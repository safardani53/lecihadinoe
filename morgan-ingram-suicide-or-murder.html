Holes played a pivotal role in breaking the case open when he uploaded DNA from one of the Golden State crime scenes to a genealogy website in the hopes of finding a match — leading to the subsequent identification and arrest of suspect Joseph DeAngelo. (The DNA evidence allegedly linked DeAngelo to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>at least 13 murders and 50 rapes</a> across California throughout the 1970s and ‘80s.)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">• <b><i>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? </i></b><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><b><i>Click here</i></b></a><b><i> to get breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases in the True Crime Newsletter.</i></b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was drawn to the case of Morgan Ingram because the initial investigation left many stones unturned, from the stalking allegations to her initial death not [being] looked at as a homicide. … We dug deep to find out what really happened to her,” Holes said of his involvement with the Oxygen special.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>RIP Morgan Ingram/Facebook</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>the Post Independent</a>, after Ingram’s death, an initial autopsy report stated she had died of natural causes as a result of a genetic metabolic disorder called acute intermittent porphyria. However, the coroner changed his report eight months later, stating that Ingram had died by suicide after ingesting an overdose of the prescription drug amitriptyline. (She had not been taking the drug — prescribed to treat various conditions including headaches and depression — at the time of her death, though she had in the past.)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Morgan Ingram CrimeStoppers poster.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Colorado Crime Stoppers</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, a bevy of theories have arisen about the final moments of the bright student who loved animals, ballet and photography.
