Why?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Euphoria depicts stories of addiction, sexuality, and so much more. Exactly what you’d think about a prestige drama starring Zendaya.</p><p>It’s been attacked for including a trans actress, for its depiction of drugs, and for it’s degree of nudity. The usual prudes.</p><p>This time, however, the criticism is coming from a pecular portion of viewers and from people who’ve never even watched the show.</p><p>During a segment from Sunday’s episode, one character is revealed to be a popular fanfiction writer.</p><p>Rather than writing about fictional characters — be they in Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, or Star Trek — this character writes about real people.</p><p>This practice is known as RPF, and the real people about whom this character famously writes are Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/louis-tomlinson-at-kiss-fm-754x1024.jpg><p>As a fictional couple, the very real people Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson are known as Larry Stylinson.&nbsp;</p><p>Euphoria did more than just mention that one character wrote fanficiton of them.</p><p>The show actually showed a short animated clip, heavily stylized, to illustrate the fanfic.</p><p>Much more engaging to viewers than just having a voiceover read part of the fic would be.</p><p>But what might have just been a cute TV moment about a creative expression of sexuality ended up causing an uproar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"I’m? So? Confused? Who allowed Euphoria to use Harry & Louis’ names? Are lou & harry aware that this happened?" asked one fan on Twitter.</p><p>"Like they must be-it’s hbo so they probably had to like have some form of permission from lou & harry’s management or them themselves," they guessed.</p><p>The tweet continued: "But why would anyone allow that?"</p><p>Public figures are allowed to be referenced and even caricatured</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"Just saw the euphoria scene of harry & louis & i’m so disgusted," tweeted another deeply scandalized 1D fan.</p><p>"Louis clearly said that the ship ruined their friendship & some prick decided to air that on tv with their real names for everyone to see," the tweet accused.</p><p>"If we’re this uncomfortable," the fan generalized. "I can’t imagine how they’re feeling."</p><p>"If euphoria really has an animated larry sex scene," tweeted another. "i am going to be LIVID that’s so disrespectful and f– GROSS."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Showrunner Sam Levinson explained to the LA Times about the process of bringing fanfiction to the screen.</p><p>"Something that I thought was a fascinating or exciting idea," he begins.</p><p>Levinson continues: "was to take this burgeoning curiosity about sexuality that’s ultimately framed through the lens of fan fiction and allow it to come to life."</p><p>"It’s sort of what Kat’s dream would be if she could see an animation of one of her stories," he explains of the animation.</p><p>Levinson adds: "That was the impetus behind it. It’s sort of allowing her wishes to come true."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In case anyone who is not familiar with how fandoms work is wondering, the show’s creators didn’t pull this idea out of thin air.</p><p>If you look at AO3 (Archive Of Our Own, created after fanfiction.net started purging stories based upon content), you can see that it’s very popular.</p><p>Explicit fics about Harry and Louis currently total 7044.</p><p>The most recent 10 of which were either added or updated in July — and it’s currently July 2.</p><p>By the time that you finish reading this article, it’s likely that the number will have grown.</p><p>And those are only the explicit-rated fics. All of the fics combined reach a total of nearly 34,000.</p><p>All that Euphoria did was bring the works of that passionate fanbase onto the small screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>People who strongly oppose specific (relation)ships, or the very concept of shipping real people, are often called antis.</p><p>They are sometimes referred to as puriteens, a clever nod to their puritannical views and to how many of them are very young.</p><p>The truth is that, for most of history, huge chunks of famous literature and art have been "fanfiction" involving real people.</p><p>Contrary to what these folks think, it’s harmless in and of itself and it’s fairly normal (just look at reality TV fandoms).</p><p>The trick for everyday folks who "ship" real people, be they YouTubers or singers, is to just … being a grownup about it. Don’t @ them on Twitter.</p><p>That’s it. It’s that simple. The people flipping out about Euphoria need to relax.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WEcLHUqZ%2BoqpmWerS4wKaknpxdpMOmvoyrmK6mk53Gbr%2FCnqWeZaeewal5x5qpq7FdqMG6uMSsZKWnpZ7AbsDOpqNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
