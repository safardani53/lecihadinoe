Cave’s 15-year-old son, Arthur Cave, died in 2015 after falling off a cliff in England. Cave composed Ghosteen, his 2019 album with The Bad Seeds, in honor of his younger kid.&nbsp;Lazenby, an Australian actor, and model was recently sentenced to jail for a violent assault on his mother, Beau Lazenby, at her house in Melbourne.</p><h2>Nick Cave’s late son Jethro Lazenby</h2><p>Jethro was born in Melbourne in 1991, and when he was eight years old, he realized Cave was his father. After being spotted in the city, he became a model, although he had also dabbled in acting, appearing in 2007’s Corroboree and 2011’s My Little Princess. He’d also worked as a photographer lately.&nbsp;He was only freed from the Melbourne Remand Center on bond on May 5 after a court-ordered him to attend drug addiction treatment and to avoid contact with his mother for the next two years.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jethro-Lazenby-2.jpg alt="Jethro Lazenby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lazenby’s lawyer, Sean Ghattas, argued that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which had impacted his judgment. In 2018, he was sentenced to jail for a series of violent attacks on his then-girlfriend.&nbsp;Nick’s wife Susie uploaded a picture of Jethro on Instagram with the comment “Darling Jethro” after Jethro died.</p><p>Nick Cave has previously explained how he coped with grief in the years after his son Arthur’s death:</p><p>“In recent years, Susie [Cave’s wife] and I have learnt a lot about the nature of grieving.” We’ve realized that mourning isn’t something you go through because there isn’t another side.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jethro-Lazenby-3.jpg alt="Jethro Lazenby" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cave is most known for his work with The Bad Seeds, a Melbourne-based band he started in 1983.
