In an awkward interview with <a href=#>Good Day New York</a>, the actor said "it's a shame" his ex-girlfriend's pictures were stolen.</p><p>"It's shocking that things like that happen in the world," the Young Ones actor said when Lawrence's nudes were brought up. "It's a shame."</p><p>Making things even more awkward, Lawrence recently <a href=#>broke her silence to Vanity Fair</a> about the images, admitting that they were for then-boyfriend Hoult, 24. "I started to write an apology, but I don't have anything to say I'm sorry for," the Oscar winner told the mag. "I was in a loving, healthy, great relationship for four years. It was long distance, and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn or he's going to look at you."</p><p>Lawrence went on to shame those who've looked at the stolen pics. "Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this. It does not mean that it comes with the territory. It's my body, and it should be my choice, and the fact that it is not my choice is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that we even live in that kind of world," she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offense," Lawrence added. "You should cower with shame."</p><p>Hoult and Lawrence split this past August. At the time, a source told Us the breakup was due to their "difficult schedules." Lawrence is now dating Coldplay frontman <strong>Chris Martin</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0Wajmq%2BimruksdJmnLFlnp6wqbvLmqpmoJ%2BqubV5wpqjpatdobKit8SdZKetlJp6sbTOraasZZFiwKmtzJ5ka2hhaYZyfI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
