It was a strange, weird claim.</p><p>At the time, we theorized that she was pranking her mother to get revenge for her mom’s Snapchat antics, but Brielle didn’t exactly explain herself … until now.</p><p>As it turns out,&nbsp;</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>So, back in November, Brielle&nbsp;Biermann took to Twitter and shared that her mother was pregnant with what would be her seventh child.</p><p>She deleted the tweet without explanation and Kim clarified that she was not, in fact, pregnant.</p><p>At the time, we guessed that perhaps Brielle was getting back at her mother for <a href=#>sharing a Snapchat&nbsp;video of Brielle flashing her boob</a>. It had been part of a conversation (with Khloe Kardashian), and clearly not something that Brielle had wanted to go public.</p><p>But we were just speculating.</p><p>Now, <a href=#>Brielle Biermann tells&nbsp;TooFab</a>&nbsp;the reason&nbsp;why she tweeted that goofy claim about her mom.</p><p>"My mom posted a video of me on her Snapchat that really irritated me, so I was sitting downstairs with two of my best friends, and I was like, you know what, I’m gonna tweet that she’s expecting."</p><p>We told you so.</p><p>"I didn’t think it would take off as quick as it did, but within 10 minutes, it was everywhere."</p><p>Well, yeah. Kim Zolciak’s easily one of the most famous Real Housewives. And, again, this would have been her seventh child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Brielle&nbsp;was entertained, and she also describes how her mother reacted.</p><p>"I was dying laughing. She wasn’t even mad, she was just like, ‘What the f–k is wrong with you?’"</p><p>To us, that sounds like a pretty healthy response for a mother to have to her (adult!) daughter.</p><p>In fact, Brielle&nbsp;has a very succinct statement for anyone who doesn’t like how close she is with her mom.</p><p>"F–k off."</p><p>In general, she’s noticed that there are a lot of people with opinions about her.</p><p>"It’s my life, and I don’t know why people are so concerned with it."</p><p>True — though if they were less concerned with her, she might have a harder time doing product endorsements on Instagram.</p><p>She understands that, though, and is grateful to have a balance. She’d just rather that people not get upset.</p><p>"I understand I’m in the public eye and people are interested, but my life does not affect you, and until it does, just let me live my life the way that I want to."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Brielle&nbsp;actually talks about her mother-daughter dynamic.</p><p>We didn’t really expect to be saying this, but Brielle seems to have a pretty good grasp of healthy family bonds.</p><p>"People see my relationship with my mom as too friendly, but I don’t think you could ever be too friendly with your parents."</p><p>Personally, I agree. Especially when we’re talking about adult children.</p><p>"I think some parents aren’t close enough with their kids, and communication is key in my family."</p><p>You’d need a lot of it, in a family of 8.</p><p>"My whole life, I’ve told her everything that goes on, even stupid things or things she may not be comfortable with hearing."</p><p>Wow. A lot of families would love to have that honesty. But you’d need a parent who is really, truly trustworthy.</p><p>"She is truly my best friend, and I hope that it stays that way."</p><p>That’s so sweet!</p><p>"I tell her all the time, I’m like, ‘I know I’m your favorite.’"</p><p>We wonder what Kim would have to say about that.</p><p>"We’re super close, and I just like to f-ck with her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Brielle’s pretty conscious of her role as a young, hot reality star.</p><p>But she says that people don’t necessarily know the real her.</p><p>"People see only 30 minutes of my life once a week for like 12 weeks and that’s it."</p><p>To be fair, plenty of people also see her on social media. But that, too, only shows part of the story.</p><p>"They don’t really know me, they don’t know what goes on behind the scenes and they don’t see what really happens."</p><p>Of course.</p><p>"They feel like they know us because they see the show, but that’s not who I really am."</p><p>She’s not just a gorgeous party girl with an unnecessarily hot boyfriend, but we kind of figured that.</p><p>"There’s a certain image I want the world to see and a certain image I have for my family and friends."</p><p>We all wear different masks with different people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And Brielle knows that, to a certain degree, we all play different roles in different environments.</p><p>"I feel like everybody needs that balance."</p><p>So what is she or isn’t she?</p><p>"I’m not this ditsy, crazy girl that has no goals in life. I’m just struggling to find my passion."</p><p>That’s totally normal — especially for a young woman in her twenties.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Brielle Biermann: Her Most Jaw-Dropping, Internet-Breaking Moments</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2Z%2FcK7RopylpJVir6qx0aaYp6ZdmsWxuMCipaxlm566bsbOpZqimZtivbOxxqeYp5upYr2zrc2kZKJlp5a7tbHDZqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
