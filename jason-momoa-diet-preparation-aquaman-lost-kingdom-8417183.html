I just eat," Momoa told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E! News</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His food plan was completely flexible as well — not much was off-limits, he said. When asked what he ate in the lead-up to and during filming, he replied, "Everything. Because you're burning so many calories, I just eat and consume. I'm constantly moving and work long days."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just shovel it in, and then work hard," he added. "Work hard, eat hard, play hard, just do it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While portraying the half-Atlantean/half-human superhero means showing off his muscular physique, Momoa said his diet and fitness regimen is more about keeping his body healthy to film physically demanding scenes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't really do it for vanity," he told the outlet. "It's more so I don't get hurt. You've got to be prepared. You're putting on a suit that's going to weigh 40 pounds. You've got to be able to move. That kind of action just puts a lot of weight on your knees. So, you just do it so you don't get hurt."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Momoa also opened up about how fans will get to see a new side of Aquaman in the upcoming film, as the character is now a husband (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Amber Heard</a> plays wife Mera) and a father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's all things I never got to play in the last four films that I've done,"&nbsp;the&nbsp;actor told E! News, adding, "I'm like, 'People need to see this side of him.' So that was my request, and I think people are going to really love it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a behind-the-scenes clip from the movie released last month, Momoa declared, "Feels good to be back," as he's seen holding the character's golden trident on set.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sequel to the 2018 original follows Aquaman as Black Manta (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</a>) returns to once again try to take revenge on Atlantis. Aquaman and his half-brother (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Patrick Wilson</a>) join forces to stop Black Manta from destroying the kingdom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the clip, Mateen II, 37, praised Momoa for bringing a unique point of view to his portrayal of the famous comic book character. "Jason's brought his own self and his style, his taste and his culture. He introduced the world to that side of Aquaman," he said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Patrick Wilson (left) and Jason Momoa in 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy Warner Bros Pictures/DC Comics</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wilson, 50 agreed, noting that the character "is so much of Jason."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He's able to bring out [all] sides of himself onscreen," Wilson added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Momoa teased that the stakes for Aquaman are higher than ever now that he has a family to protect.
