The pair then welcomed five children — Michael, Kevin, Daniel, Mary Rose and James — and in 1975, they divorced after 17 years of marriage. In the divorce settlement, Phil retained custody of his four sons, while Cooney got custody of their daughter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Phil married Marlo on May 21, 1980. Marlo became the kids’ stepmother — a role she was happy to take on. In May 2011, Marlo told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>AARP.org</a> that she never planned to be a “mother to Phil’s children in the traditional sense” because they already had a mom. She said she wanted to be a “friend” instead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When I was growing up, my mother was always a friend to my siblings and me (in addition to being all the other things a mom is)," she explained. "I was always grateful for that because I knew she was someone I could talk to and joke with, and argue with and that nothing would ever harm that friendship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marlo continued, “So I used that model with Phil's kids, and I'm proud to say that the friendships I established with them are as strong today as they were 30 years ago — even stronger.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From 1967 to 1996, Phil hosted The Phil Donahue Show. In January 1980, he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Washington Post</a> that it felt like his life was beginning to imitate the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I noticed that my children weren't really sharing feelings with me — and one of the reasons was I don't do a hell of a lot of sharing with them in terms of feelings,” he said. “And I began to examine why, listen to some of the shrinks and people who do our show. I began to realize that not much in the way we were raised encouraged that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After&nbsp;The Phil Donahue Show&nbsp;ended, Phil returned to prime time in 2002 with the MSNBC show&nbsp;Donahue. That year,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah Winfrey</a>&nbsp;interviewed Phil for&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>O, The Oprah Magazine</a>&nbsp;and asked what his children thought of his return to television.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“They're surprised. But they've also said, ‘Go get 'em, Pop,’ ” he said. “I'm not 29 anymore, my wife isn't pregnant, I'm not trying to raise kids, I don't have a mortgage — so it takes less courage for me to speak up.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s what to know about Phil Donahue and Marlo Thomas’ five children: Michael, Kevin, Daniel, Mary Rose and James.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-michael-phillip-donahue></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Michael Phillip Donahue</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Robin Platzer/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Phil and Cooney’s oldest child is son Michael Phillip Donahue, born in 1959.

The couple tied the knot at St. Michael Parish in Greenwich, Connecticut. Reed graduated from Saint Michael's College with a bachelor of arts in sociology and later from Boston College with a master’s degree in social work. In 2020, Marlo <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared on Facebook</a> that for more than 20 years, Reed was the owner and director of the Little Red Wagon PlaySchool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Reed has been an advocate for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, which was founded by Marlo’s father, comedian Danny Thomas. In September 2021, Marlo wrote on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> that Reed was a “true guardian angel” for St. Jude.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Michael and Reed are parents to two children: a son, Connor, and a daughter, Kenzie. Marlo referred to her stepgrandson — who is also her godson — as her “soulmate” on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though Marlo and her grandchildren are not biologically related, she shows plenty of love and affection for them. In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>another post</a> from 2015, Marlo wrote, “Kenzie is not my [biological] grandchild. But I love her as I do all my biological nieces and nephews. She is my family and I love every moment of her dear life that we have shared.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kevin-john-donahue></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Kevin John Donahue</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Marlo Thomas Facebook</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Phil and Cooney’s second child is their son Kevin John Donahue, born in about 1959.
