It’s similar to how, in an automobile, if even one bit of dirt goes into the eye of the needle of the jet, there’s a bang and no more gas comes through. That is what happens to your heart.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jay-Leno-1.jpg alt="Jay Leno" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More about Jay Leno, the comedian-host</h2><p>For a few years, Jay Leno worked as a stand-up comedian.
