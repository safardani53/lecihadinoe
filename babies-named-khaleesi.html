Some 560 babies in 2018 alone were named "Khaleesi" according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security Administration</a>. That makes it the 549th most popular name in the US, just behind Mariam (my wife's name!) and 548 spots shy of Emma. You don't mess with Emma when it comes to naming girls.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Beast</a> interviewed one such mother to a "Khaleesi." Understandably, she wasn't a huge fan of the direction the series took with one of the last surviving lead female characters. Jasmine Estrada from Miami hopped on the Khaleesi train early, as her daughter is 6 years old now.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was kind of disappointing that her power trip took over. That was not cool. [I don't] like the outcome of what she represents...[and the name's] kind of bittersweet right now."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Some mothers of Mothers of Dragons out there, however, are sticking by their name choice and favorite character. Katherine Acosta tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a> she thinks Daenerys did what she had to do to claim her rightful place on the Iron Throne. I don't think she's going to like what happens <a href=#>at the end of the show</a> if some spoilers are to be believed.</p><p>Katherine, who has a 1-year-old named after the Targaryen Queen, says, "I'm still behind her. Even after last night's episode, I'm still rooting for her. I don't think she did anything wrong. I think she did what she had to do. After the episode, a lot of people kept tagging me on memes and being like, 'How do you feel that Khaleesi has that name now that Daenerys did all of that?' I'm like, I don't feel anything different. It's not like she did it just 'cause. If you watch the show, she had every right."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><p>I don't want to jump to conclusions, but if I were a betting man, I'd wager Katherine is the type of mom who will argue with teachers because "my kid can do nothing wrong." At least her little Khaleesi can rest easy knowing she can firebomb a whole city and still have her mom's support, no matter what.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><p>Other moms doubling down on their support for the Mad Queen include Channy and Nikki Sotto, who spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> about naming their kids after someone who murders innocent people.</p><p>Sotto personally feels bad for Dany, saying her actions were justified. "What girl hasn’t overreacted when they see their whole world crumbling around them? I feel for her. I’m just bummed Jon and her have to be related. I wanted them to live happily ever after."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>I imagine that, even if you did name your daughter Khaleesi and not Daenerys, any nasty feelings associated with the name would be assuaged by the knowledge that, when she was a Khaleesi and not Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, she was a kind, compassionate ruler who cared about her soldiers and liberated slaves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>So I guess if you're one of the moms who decided to name your daughter after The Mad Queen, just remind the world that there are actual serial killers in real life with names like John, Ted, and Jeffrey.</p><p>If you name your kid "Lecter," though, well... that's probably on you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl66jtcSsZKeZnZqxbrfHmqOenaOe</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
