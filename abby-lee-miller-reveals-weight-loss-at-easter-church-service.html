She wore a sequined top over black pants and loafers, accessorizing with large hoop <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> and a few rings.</p><p>As previously reported, <a href=#>Miller was released from a federal prison</a> in California on Tuesday, March 27, after serving eight months for bankruptcy fraud. She is now staying at a halfway house, where she will be expected to continue following many strict conditions.</p><p>According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, the reality star cannot unlawfully use controlled substances and must submit to one drug test within 15 days of her release, in addition to at least two more tests thereafter. She must also report to a probation officer, cannot possess a firearm and cannot communicate with anyone she knows to be engaged in criminal activity, among other conditions.</p><p>Miller — who lost about 100 pounds during her time behind bars, according to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> — was indicted in 2015 after she attempted to hide approximately $775,000 of income from Dance Moms, the spinoff <a href=#>Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition</a> and other projects.</p><p>The dance instructor pleaded guilty to bankruptcy fraud in 2016. She was <a href=#>sentenced to 366 days in prison</a> and was also ordered to pay a $40,000 fine along with a $120,000 judgment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Miller previously told Us exclusively that she <a href=#>would like to get back to work</a> immediately after being released from prison. “I hope to come out and have a new TV show, a scripted show that I’ve created,” she said in May 2017. “You know, a teenage show where Dance Moms leaves off, what should happen next — because I know what should happen next.”</p><p>But for now, Miller is adjusting to life outside of prison. She enjoyed a <a href=#>relaxing afternoon at a nail salon</a> on Wednesday, March 29, marking the first time she was spotted since her release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaampKueq2xxGakoqScmr9uvsSvnJqko2LEprXGoatmpJ%2BowG6t02acmqukmr9ur8euqZygXaiys8LInJxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
