finally had his visa approved</a> and could come to the United States.</p><p>The two had previously been separated by an ocean and legal hurdles, and their updates these days are from the U.S.</p><p>Avery has also revealed something that a few fans already suspected: she and Omar were secretly married before filming their on-screen nuptials.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Avery Mills — seen here with her husband, Omar, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — was not an instant fan-favorite.</p><p>People questioned her youth, and her portrayal as being wishy-washy or even flaky on the show made people doubt her decision-making.</p><p>However, the authenticity of her love story, her relationship, and of Avery herself won people over, and these two are a widely beloved couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This week, Avery revealed that one part of her story was not as authentic as viewers were led to believe.</p><p>Taking to TikTok, she shared (in a now-deleted video, which raises some questions) some "big tea" about her past.</p><p>Teasing fans before announcing the news, Avery wrote:&nbsp;“I’ve never told people this bc I thought I would get in trouble.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Almost like a subliminal message (but not really), Avery’s confession popped up towards the end of her TikTok video.</p><p>"Omar and I got secretly married when we were in Lebanon," she revealed.</p><p>Avery shared that this was "because we were warned by a camera man that the show will try to mess up our wedding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Not even the show knows about it," Avery admitted.</p><p>"And," she detailed, "my mom didn’t find out until after."</p><p>Like many little white lies, no matter how good the intentions, very naturally led to some other necessary embellishments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"So, in teh scene that I was mad at Omar for not getting the wedding ready," Avery recalled.</p><p>She confessed: "I had to act like I was so mad at him."</p><p>"But in reality," Avery explained, "we already got married earlier that morning."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Avery and Omar aren’t the first cast members who were married before their on-screen wedding.</p><p>This has happened before, dating all of the way back to Season 2.</p><p>Some will argue that 90 Day Fiance producers are going to far when things like this happen, but let’s look at the facts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>First of all, as Avery made clear, this was not the show’s doing.</p><p>One member of the production team advised her good-naturedly that getting married ahead of time was a good idea.</p><p>It’s not that producers were going to unleash a swarm of bees at the wedding — but an already married couple could have real peace of mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That doesn’t mean that the subsequent footage wasn’t dishonest, but that it wasn’t production’s fault.</p><p>Avery did what she had to do for her marriage and her happiness.</p><p>Reality stars re-take scenes or re-hash arguments all of the time for the camera. This was just, you know, a bit more than that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>By the way, "fake weddings" like Avery and Omar did for the camera aren’t reality television exclusives.</p><p>Real neighbors don’t go on annual vacations like Real Housewives do, and no real dating situation compares to any Bachelor’s.</p><p>But people in real life marry secretly before their official weddings all of the time. It’s a smart move for the couple’s sanity, and harms no one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We want to be clear that there are instances where production and editing have absolutely gone too far with the show.</p><p>Horrible behavior has been effectively covered up, and reasonable people have been edited to look unreasonable just to get a rise out of viewers.</p><p>But we don’t begrudge Avery and Omar for this fib. We’re just so glad that they found each other and their happily ever after.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcK3VnqmyZZ2eua2%2FjKJkppmip7amsIyopJqqXZa5o63KpKauql2Xsqe70Z5ksJ1dm7atucSdZKitomK8r3nSnKlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
