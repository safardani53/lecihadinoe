Dionne comes for a family of singers, as her mother, aunts and uncles were members of the renowned family gospel group, the Drinkard Singers. Dionne began singing gospel as a child and performed her first solo at the age of six. After graduating high school in 1959, she was awarded a scholarship to the Hartt College of Music in Hartford, Connecticut. Dionne formed the group, The Gospelaires, in 1958. The group began singing background sessions in New York, leading Dionne to connect with <strong>Burt Bacharach</strong>, who helped&nbsp;get her&nbsp;first solo record deal in 1962. Her first single, “Don’t Make Me Over,” was her first Top 40 Pop hit. From there, she found additional success in the 1960s and ‘70s, including “Alfie,”&nbsp;“I Say a Little Prayer” and “Do You Know the Way to San Jose,” which won her first Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. “Then Came You” in 1974 was her first No.1 hit, a success she replicated only in 1985 with “That’s What Friends Are For.”&nbsp;During the 1990s, Dionne hosted infomercials for the Psychic Friends Network, but was dismayed when she was being referred to as “the psychic lady on TV.” Dionne declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy due to mismanagement of her business affairs in 2013.
