It is not clear if this is related to his passing.</p><p>"We are saddened by the news today that our Compadre, Dusty Hill, has passed away in his sleep at home in Houston, TX," Frank and Billy's July 28 post read.&nbsp;"We, along with legions of ZZ Top fans around the world, will miss your steadfast presence, your good nature and enduring commitment to providing that monumental bottom to the â€˜Top'.
