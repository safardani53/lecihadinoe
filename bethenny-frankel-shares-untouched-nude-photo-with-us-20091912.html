The pregnant Real Housewives of New York star posed nude for a PETA billboard that was unveiled Dec. 15 in Manhattan's Times Square. Now, she's talking back to the <a href=#>housewives and other haters </a>who have suggested that the butt-baring photo was heavily airbrushed — and she's shared the photo evidence (the original, untouched image) exclusively with <a href=#>UsMagazine.com</a>.</p><p>"Everything I'm about is being honest and being upfront," Frankel, 39, tells <a href=#>UsMagazine.com</a>. "So if people are talking and saying [the photo] was airbrushed…then, you know what? Here's the picture. Have it your way."</p><p>The author of new cookbook The Skinnygirl Dish adds that she would "never, ever allow them to put up a billboard that was really far from the truth."</p><p>Now four months pregnant with her first child, Frankel disrobed for the shots on a Manhattan rooftop in September. Although she's never posed nude before, she says "I wasn't that freaked out about it. I don't know why. PETA has no interest in making me look sleazy. It was such an honor."</p><p>As for the pregnancy? "It's been great. I haven't been particularly nauseous, and I get a decent night's sleep, which is refreshing. My boobs are big, but other than that, nothing's crazy."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Still, she confides that expecting a baby is a "weird" experience, "To be honest, being pregnant is weird. Whoever says any different is probably lying. It's a strange, strange thing."</p><p>The dad-to-be is Frankel's fiance, Jason Hoppy. Although the couple announced their engagement in October, they have put off planning their nuptials until after Frankel gets through her pregnancy, a book tour, the third season of Housewives (which just wrapped shooting) and her new untitled solo reality show. "There's no plan whatsoever!" Frankel says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtedKhmKudo2LCr8DOrpqhnZRiu7awxGanoaekpHq4tdOhZK6rXWd9cYWQcmhrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
