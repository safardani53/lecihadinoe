Fury of the Gods</a>’ post-credits scene.</p><p>One of two the two end credits in the sequel film — which hit theaters on Friday, March 17 — sees Levi’s titular superhero being recruited for The Justice Society of America, a superhero team featured in Johnson’s 2022 film Black Adam. According to a report by <a href=#>The Wrap</a>, published on Tuesday, March 21, Johnson, 50, prevented Shazam! 2 director <strong>David F. Sandberg</strong> from using any of the team’s characters in the scene, resulting in Peacemaker characters Emilia Harcourt (<strong>Jennifer Holland</strong>) and John Economos (<a href=#><strong>Steve Agee</strong></a>) doing the recruiting instead.</p><p>On top of that, the report also claimed that the <a href=#>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</a> star shut down a possible cameo from Levi, 42, in Black Adam — which he produced in addition to starring in — despite Shazam and Black Adam being each other’s biggest foes in the comics.</p><p>The Tangled star appeared to confirm the revelations <a href=#>via his Instagram Story</a> on Tuesday, March 21. Sharing a screenshot of another Instagram Story featuring The Wrap’s reporting, Levi captioned his post, “The truth shall set you free,” complete with an upside-down smiley face and raised hands emojis.</p><p>Sandberg, 42, previously spoke out about the post-credit scene casting switch-up, telling <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in an interview published on March 18 that the scene “fell apart three days before we were going to roll cameras.”</p><p>He continued: “<strong>Peter Safran</strong>, who produced this movie and Peacemaker, made some calls, and thankfully, Jen Holland and Steve Agee were able to come by on very short notice. I mean, the scene makes a little less sense with them. It’s like, ‘Why are they recruiting for Justice Society?’ but you can kind of see it as they’re working for Amanda Waller [<a href=#><strong>Viola Davis</strong></a>]. So I was just very grateful to get them in there, and it was really cool shooting it because I’m a big fan of Peacemaker.”</p><p>HBO’s Peacemaker is a spin-off of <a href=#><strong>James Gunn</strong></a>’s 2021 film <a href=#>The Suicide Squad</a> and follows <a href=#><strong>John Cena</strong></a>’s titular anti-hero’s latest misadventures.</p><p>All of the drama comes amid major shakeups in the DC Universe. Gunn, 56, and Safran, 57, took over as DC Studios’ new co-chairman and chief executive officers in November 2022. The duo announced they plan to reboot most of the franchise’s major properties, <a href=#>which includes letting go</a> of <a href=#><strong>Henry Cavill</strong></a>’s Superman and canceling several announced projects, including <strong>Patty Jenkins</strong>’ <a href=#>Wonder Woman 3</a> with <a href=#><strong>Gal Gadot</strong></a>, among others. The fates of other characters, including Black Adam and Shazam, are currently up in the air.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One of the things Peter & I were aware of when we took the job as heads of DC Studios was a certain minority of people online that could be, well, uproarious & unkind, to say the least,” the <a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy</a> director <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> in December 2022. “Our choices for the DCU are based upon what we believe is best for the story & best for the DC characters who have been around for nearly 85 years. Perhaps these choices are great, perhaps not, but they are made with sincere hearts & integrity & always with the story in mind.”</p><p>Gunn — who <a href=#>tied the knot with Holland</a>, 36, in October 2022 — continued: “No one loves to be harassed or called names — but, to be frank, we’ve been through significantly worse. Disrespectful outcry will never, ever affect our actions. We were aware there would be a period of turbulence when we took this gig, & we knew we would sometimes have to make difficult & not-so-obvious choices, especially in the wake of the factious nature of what came before us. But this means little to us in comparison to our jobs as artists & custodians in helping to create a wide & wonderful future for DC.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaLGam5iWv7p5y56tomWjna6lsdJmm7CZqaOybrbOoaWsp55ivLex0WaYsZ2UYsCprdmapGZqXZiurrHOaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
