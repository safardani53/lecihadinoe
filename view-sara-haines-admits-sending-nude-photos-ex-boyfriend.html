I forgot to tell you guys," she laughed when Sunny gave her a shocked look.</p><p>"Emails?" <a href=#>Joy Behar</a> asked.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"No, no digital photos. It wasn't a phone. He still has them I think," Sara, 45, admitted.</p><p>Ana asked if she could put her face on Sara's body, then Sunny asked if they were explicit.</p><p>Joy wondered if she was completely nude and Sara said she had a hat on before cracking up.</p><p>"The point is, to this day, I literally still trust this man. We were in a relationship for many years. I love him. He loves me still. He is such a good person that- I would trust him completely," she revealed.</p><h2><strong>CHEEKY VIEW</strong></h2><p>Although this is the first time Sara has opened up about something like this, she hasn't shied away from NSFW topics before.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sara and Sunny made a <a href=#>sexual joke</a> in an NSFW live TV moment.</p><p>During the final segment of the show,&nbsp;the co-hosts were joined by&nbsp;<a href=#>Oprah</a>&nbsp;Daily's creative director Adam Glassman.</p><p>The trio cycled through a number of beauty and skincare products that were immediately available to be purchased by the viewers.</p><p>Adam began by introducing a face roller made by his favorite facialist in Los Angeles, Nurse Jamie.</p><p>He demonstrated the product while narrating, "It uplifts. It massages your face, it tightens your face."</p><p>Sunny then asked: "Is it cold?"</p><p>To which Adam responded, "No, it is not cold...but these right here, these cryo-balls are amazing."</p><p>The creative director pointed to a pair of metallic orbs positioned on the other side of the display.</p><p>Sara checked them out and exclaimed, "Cold balls!" much to the delight of the audience.</p><p>She kept the joking rolling as Sunny took her turn demonstrating the product.</p><p>Sarah remarked, "You rub it on your face," accompanied by the continued chuckles from inside the studio.</p><p>Sunny told her to "check this out," which Sara did while giving the audience a knowing glance.</p><p>She let out a sensuous, "Oh yeah," before moving on to the next product.</p><h2><strong>OH, SARA!</strong></h2><p>Last month, Sara also <a href=#>made a NSFW joke </a>to Joy, after talking about the <a href=#>Covid-19</a> booster.</p><p>The conversation peaked with&nbsp;Joy, never one to shy away from a risqué joke, to make a comment about her experience getting the shots to protect against the virus.</p><p>"I just got my third booster," she stated. "I've been jabbed more than I was on my honeymoon."</p><p>Her co-hosts and the audience erupted in laughter at the unexpected remark.</p><p>"I mean, I've had five shots," Joy continued while holding her hand to the crowd.</p><p>Joy went on to reveal she had recently received yet another booster, to which Sunny&nbsp;asked: "Did your arm hurt after?"</p><p>But before Joy could finish her answer,&nbsp;Sara surprisingly interjected, asking Joy: "What about the wedding night? Did you hurt?"</p><p>The out-of-nowhere quip brought the roof down, as everyone burst out in laughter, while Sara turned a bright red.</p><p>Sunny joked: "I didn't say that. That was the good girl from Iowa. I didn't say that," glancing over at Sara.</p><p>Amused by her co-host's remark, Joy chuckled: "She likes a callback."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Sara Haines gettin frisky on morning TV," one viewer tweeted at the time.</p><p>Another followed: "Oh Sara got jokes…"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/naughty-view-view-s-sara-771342114-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/naughty-view-view-s-sara-771341941.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZWp%2FdYCRaK2inadiwKK%2BwGafmqGemsBurcOmoK2rXaiyr7DIp55mpqWZsm68x6irqKtdmsVurs6ynauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
