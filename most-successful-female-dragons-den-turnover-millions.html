I never knew normal.</p><p>“I was taken into care at eight months old until the age of three, when I was returned to three parents – long story, but there were a lot of mental health issues between the three of them, and it was a very dysfunctional dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p>“We never had money; I vividly remember digging through a pile of clothes on the floor in front of the washing machine, trying to find the cleanest shirt with the least mould on it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="More on Dragons' Den">More on Dragons' Den</h2><p>“I was called ‘fleabag’ at school.”</p><p>She ended up living in 13 different houses and going to nine different schools.</p><p>Despite this start in life, Rachel was determined to be successful and to not “go back to a place of financial insecurity.”</p><p>She said: “It was by pure chance that Tiny Box Company was created.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“I originally started a Fairtrade-type jewellery business and when I had to consider my packaging options, I found that no one was producing eco-friendly, good quality packaging in small quantities for the average small business.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s when I found the gap in the market and decided to fill it – with Tiny Boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>“I started in my bedroom at my parents’ house, which lasted about six months.&nbsp;</p><p>“My parents lived in tied accommodation which didn’t allow business activity and a trustee found out, so I was forced to get my first proper office and throw myself into it fully.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of hard grafting and late nights helped expand operations. We grew quite quickly, even before Dragons’ Den.”</p><p>She said her first lot of stock cost £4,000 and she sold “everything she had” to raise the money.</p><p>Tiny Box was launched in 2007, but Rachel acknowledged that she needed help for the business to grow.</p><p>It was actually Rachel’s business partner Robin who applied for the hit BBC show, behind her back.</p><p>She said: “It wasn’t my idea at all!&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t know Tiny Box was even in the running for Dragons’ Den until I got the call from the BBC asking what I wanted the investment for.&nbsp;</p><p>“My business partner Robin had applied without telling me because he knew I never would’ve gone for it otherwise.”</p><p>In 2008, Rachel stood in front of the Dragons and impressed <a href=#>Peter Jones</a> and <a href=#>Theo Paphitis</a> so much they invested £60,000 in her idea.</p><p>Speaking of the <a href=#>filming experience</a>, she said: “What most people don’t realise is that you’re in the den for over two hours being grilled on every minute detail of your business.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s when you get the verbal ‘yes’ but after that you sit down and everything is scrutinised in even finer detail.</p><p>“The Dragons were terrifying – if you’ve seen any episode of the show, you’ve seen how intense it is for the contestants.&nbsp;</p><p>“After a long interrogation and believing I would walk away without investment, I received £30,000 from Peter and the same from Theo, for 20 per cent each.”</p><p>When she found she was getting the investment, Rachel said she “blacked out briefly” from excitement.</p><p>The entrepreneur added: “We had a detailed strategy meeting after, but the show didn’t air until about six months later.&nbsp;</p><p>“We continued trading as normal, then literally one minute after the show aired, our website crashed because we had so much traffic coming in.&nbsp;</p><p>“The show definitely gave us credibility, which can be really difficult to gain as a small business.”</p><p>Rachel confirmed Peter and Theo still own their shares in Tiny Box Company and they “keep in touch regularly.”</p><p>Huge success for Rachel came in 2021 when she first hit £10million in turnover.</p><p>She added: “Lockdown was a stressful time, with so many businesses having to lay off their staff, but it meant that a lot of side hustles turned into full time businesses, and those businesses all needed packaging, so we managed to secure a lot of new customers.&nbsp;</p><p>It is now one of the UK's largest online green gift packaging firms and has changed Rachel’s life imaginably.</p><p>She explained: “Money definitely helps in terms of comfort.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve been able to buy a beautiful house with my husband and enjoy travelling whenever my schedule permits.</p><p>“My life now is literally the polar opposite to my upbringing.&nbsp;</p><p>“My life is far more predictable and stable. I have a husband who keeps me on the straight and narrow. Most importantly, I have love.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even if I have nothing else, I feel loved. That’s the biggest thing.”</p><p>Rachel shows no signs of slowing down and even runs a second business now, <a href=#>Know The Origin</a>, which allows consumers to swap household items for a more sustainable version.</p><p>Rachel urged other women who are wanting to start a business to take the plunge.</p><p>She said: “If you have no money, start as a <a href=#>side hustle</a> and work your way up. Or find friendly investors!&nbsp;</p><p>“Tiny Box runs free clinics for people needing to talk through their business ideas or just want some advice on branding, marketing etc. The first question I always ask is ‘What do you want from your business?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“‘Where do you want to end up?’ You need a plan – even if it’s a rough outline written on a gum wrapper.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’ve always got to have the end in mind when you start anything. Once you have the vision, you can do whatever is needed to get there.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/000-turnover-recently-ceo-www-826921405.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/000-turnover-recently-ceo-www-826921406.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/000-turnover-recently-ceo-www-826921408.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FrbnFqYGd9cLnOrKtmq6WYsKa%2F0p%2BspWWWmrqiuMRmm6uZl6S7tHnDnqVmrKWnu7DCxKtkpqGcobawutJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
