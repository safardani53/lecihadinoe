this week while filming with Martin on location in Port Isaac, Cornwall.</p><p>A member of the public who saw the incident unfold said he tripped while stepping off set, buckling over a lighting rig.</p><p>Paramedics went to his aid on set, and had to give him the onceover to make sure he hadn’t suffered any long-term effects.</p><p>Onlookers had initially feared the worst, but Ian was just very shaken.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON DOC MARTIN">READ MORE ON DOC MARTIN</h2><p>A tourist, who asked not to be named, said: “At first everyone thought Ian had died.</p><p>"He hit the deck really hard and with an almighty thump.</p><p>“Thankfully, paramedics — real ones and not actors — were quickly on-hand to make sure he was OK.</p><p>“Everyone feared the worst when they first saw him lose his footing and go down.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>"The cameras stopped rolling and his safety was clearly the priority.</p><p>“He looked a bit embarrassed, understandably, but was a real pro about it all.</p><p>"It didn’t sour the experience of watching our favourite show get filmed.”</p><p>Ian has played Bert, an entrepreneurial plumber, in the series since 2004 and was back on location this week as filming started on the tenth and final series.</p><p>The show, which is criminally underrated and still a ratings hit for the channel, follows Men Behaving Badly’s Martin as Doctor Martin Ellingham in the fictional village of Portwenn.</p><p>Doc Martin decided to resign as the village’s GP in the last series, due to having his career scrutinised by the General Medical Council over of his phobia of blood.</p><p>It’s lucky for Ian the real medics weren’t so queasy.</p><h2
