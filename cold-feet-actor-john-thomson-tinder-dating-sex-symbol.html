I’ve had enough of online dating. No one believes it’s me, they think it’s a rogue profile.</p><p>“It’s just kind of awful. It’s like shopping for women and I don’t like it. It’s such a waste of time.”</p><p>John, who plays Pete Gifford in the series, is back on the market after his relationship with wife Sam broke down two years ago.</p><p>And the Salford-born 48-year-old looks briefly offended as I describe him as an “unlikely sex symbol”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rexfeatures_6082189fjpg-js348313482.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict0002592322481-e1503863979690.jpg><p>The dad-of-two said: “Well that’s the ultimate backhanded compliment really. I think that’s because I was packing a few more pounds back in the day.</p><p>“I mean I’m not too bad these days, really. I look after myself so I think I look much better than I used to in the show.</p><p>“If I was an unlikely sex symbol then, I don’t see why I’m not a likelier one now.”</p><p>Likely or unlikely symbol, the former Fast Show star is certainly not short of offers.</p><p>And he gets so much fan mail that it has to vetted by his agent so nothing dodgy gets through.</p><p>But he rules out ever sleeping with a fan of the show, as he thinks it would be “dangerous”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000330949136-e1503863904545.jpg><p>He explained: “Fan mail is pre-opened when I receive it just in case there’s anything sensitive.</p><p>“I mean it’s very different when you’re in Aerosmith and your bouncers point at, ‘Her, her, her, her’ and they’re all taken off to the hotel. That’s a different kind of set-up isn’t it?</p><p>“But Cold Feet’s not like that!</p><p>“I’ve been asked out on dates on Twitter and I’ve had phone numbers sent to me. I’ve had randoms ask me on Facebook for dates. I just don’t respond.</p><p>“It’s not in my nature and I just feel it’s probably best. I’ll say, ‘look I’m in a relationship’ and maybe sometimes I am and sometimes I’m not, just to shut the door.”</p><p>But offers of an evening out are not the oddest thing he’s had in the post, ever since his days as Jesse Chadwick on Coronation Street.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict0003483373761-e1503864172803.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000346483543.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000259231928-e1503863917151.jpg><p>He added: “I used to get some strange things at Corrie.</p><p>"I got a lot of the Koran on CD asking me to convert to Islam. I got that a couple of times, asking me if I was interested in embracing Islam. I said, ‘I’m a lapsed Catholic!’”</p><p>In the final episode of last year’s rebooted Cold Feet, which had been off-air for 13 years, Pete and wife Jenny, played by Fay Ripley, <a href=#>rekindle their romance as they romped in the toilet of best pal Adam</a> (James Nesbitt).</p><p>Being on TV <a href=#>in his very own Tom Hiddleston moment</a> meant some awkward conversations at home - with his two daughters Olivia, 14, and Sophia, seven.</p><p>He was particularly concerned about Olivia, saying: “That was a family meeting. My daughter’s 14 and I warned her about it.”</p><p>But explaining the scenes was not half as awkward as actually shooting them with Fay, 51.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000348313439-e1503864050882.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000273649723-e1503864079331.jpg><p>John recalled: “We had to do it like a porno.</p><p>“We had to do a bit of that...like extraneous noises. Where we rehearsed, it was where the holding area for the extras.</p><p>“We went through the motions and we could hear chuckling and all the extras were watching us.</p><p>“It was hysterical.</p><p>“You just get on with it but those things can be a bit embarrassing really. But I had no qualms. I’ve had my bum out a lot in this.</p><p>“If you go way back when we went to Australia (in a 2001 episode) I ran full frontal into a pool with Jimmy Nesbitt and I’m sure people have probably had a look to see where I rate on Naked Attraction.”</p><p>Nudity aside, last year’s series was a different type of story for John, who is a stand-up comic by trade.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN BIZARRE</h2></p><p>It saw John’s character Pete, working as a taxi driver, <a href=#>fall into a deep depression after troubles at his job and at home</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Viewers even briefly thought Pete had killed himself</a> when he was seen at the bottom of a cliff in a pool of blood.</p><p>Another heartbreaking moment saw Pete broke down in front of wife Jenny with pal Adam looking on — a scene that was applauded by mental health campaigners.</p><p>My daughters don't like seeing Daddy cry</p><p>And John says his daughters find these scenes far more upsetting than anything. involving his derriere.</p><p>He said: “They don’t like seeing Daddy cry. Olivia to be honest gets more upset. It broke Olivia’s heart.</p><p>“For them it’s Daddy. It’s not Pete Gifford, it’s Daddy, so I have to be mindful of exposing them to high emotion really, as a decent dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000127961393.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000193343717.jpg><p>“High emotion is worse than my a***.”</p><p>Nevertheless, he might want to schedule another family meeting, as the stripping off isn’t quite finished just yet.</p><p><a href=#>In the new series, which starts on September 8</a>, he stars in his own sex tape with Jenny.</p><p>He said of the episode: “I’ve seen a bit of that. It’s funny, it is funny.</p><p>“I’m in a silky thingy and we’re feeding each other trying to be like all sensual and erotic and it all goes wrong and it’s funny.</p><p>“A lot of it was ad-libbed and it just worked. They said: ‘Do what you want with the food in the fridge’.”</p><p>The show’s long-called-for resurrection, announced in November 2015, came just at the right time for John, who says acting is very feast and famine.</p><p>He said: “I don’t do it for the money, I do it for a job I love and the money’s secondary. But when times are lean that’s a different story.</p><p>“But I would rather do something I enjoy for less money than something mercenary for something that would make me miserable.”</p><p>One lucrative payday is the annual panto season, but John is spurning festive gigs this year in to spend more time with his daughters.</p><p>Speaking of his run in Aladdin in Manchester last Christmas he said: “It’s graft — it’s twice daily. I mean I did 53 shows in four weeks. That’s not even counting rehearsal.</p><p>“There was no life. I was trying to manage a girlfriend, an ex-wife and two kids and me — forget it. I’ve said no this year, I want to be able to spend time with my kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000348313431-e1503862955521.jpg><p>I'm horrified that Gogglebox people are doing panto</p><p>“Christmas is for children anyway. I want to see their joy.”</p><p>And in any case he admits he has also become frustrated by the number of reality TV stars and sportspeople, rather than actors, who land roles treading the festive boards.</p><p>He said of his last panto outing: “Everybody was a bona fide turn who had skills. Everyone was a proper actor or, you know, entertaining.</p><p>“I love Gogglebox but I was horrified to hear that people from Gogglebox were doing panto. It’s a craft, is pantomime.”</p><p>Cold Feet returns to ITV on Friday, September 8 at 9pm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhsY2iCeIWTaJqopJRis6ax02aYnKyfp3qru8enZK2gn6LAsLqMraCnnJWneqWt06KloGWjmsVuv9immaikXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
