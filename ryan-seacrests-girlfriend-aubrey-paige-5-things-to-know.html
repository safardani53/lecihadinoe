They think he’s a wonderful guy,” a second source told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in June 2021, noting the pair are “very happy together and doing great.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>American Idol&nbsp;</i></a>host and the aspiring screenwriter, <a href=#>who is 24 years her beau’s junior</a>, have offered glimpses into their sweet romance through the years.</p><p class=p1>“Safe to say the best part of 2021 was meeting the most incredible man&nbsp;<span class=s1>😍🙌🏼</span>,” Paige gushed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in December 2021. “Wishing everyone love, happiness, safety & health in 2022&nbsp;<span class=s1>🥂</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Seacrest previously dated <a href=#><strong>Julianne Hough</strong> </a>between 2010 and 2013. He later moved on with chef <a href=#><strong>Shayna Taylor</strong>,</a> whom he dated for eight years prior to their June 2020 split. While <a href=#>the radio personality has since found love</a> with Paige, he’s not in a rush to walk down the aisle.</p><p class=p1>“I’m happy.&nbsp;I’m happy in the present moment,” Seacrest <a href=#>confessed about the prospect of marriage</a> during an August 2022 episode of&nbsp;<i>Live With Kelly and Ryan</i>, speaking with guest host <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a>. “I <a href=#>don’t think about anything else</a>. Why push it?”</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “I think having kids at the right time would be great. I have a fantastic family, a very small family. I have a niece, [my sister] Meredith has a daughter. My parents have been married 52 and a half years, so that’s a high bar. So that’s in my head.”</p><p class=p1>Nearly one year later, Seacrest <a href=#>spoiled his love on Valentine’s Day</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“2nd vday post cause these flowers from my love deserved their own&nbsp;<span class=s1>😍</span>,” Paige gushed via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Tuesday, February 14, revealing the Venus et Fleur “I [heart] U” arrangement and balloons that her man had gifted her. “Whether you spent the day with friends, family, a lover or filling your heart with self love, I hope everyone had a beautiful Valentine’s Day&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️💌💋</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to get to know Seacrest’s girlfriend:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv7qtzWaqnpmTp7K0wNJmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSarZKnsrp5z5qgoJ1danq1tMinnqxlpKR6rLrOsGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
