Chris said before breaking out in laughter.</p><p>"And yeah, apparently, it's no bulls**t," he added, throwing his arms up in the air.</p><p>However, the TV star wasn't satisfied, telling the cameras: "First of all, she's got to get our approval before she just ups and runs off and gets married.</p><p>"So, I don't know what the hell she's thinking. That's the first thing I'm thinking."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>CONCERNS FOR TAMMY</h2><p>Amy, 35, was also dumbfounded about the arrangement, admitting she "didn't believe" her sister when she heard the news.</p><p>She confessed that it wasn't until Tammy, 36, sent her a video of the proposal did it seem real.</p><p>With a disgusted look on her face, Amy then claimed that Caleb "found out" that Tammy was staying in the Ohio rehabilitation center, enticing him to go there as well.</p><p>A source previously told The U.S. Sun that Tammy "began dating Caleb in rehab" and that he <a href=#>proposed in the facility's parking lot</a>.</p><p>The information didn't sit well with Amy, who feared the family didn't know the real Caleb.</p><p>"I don't know if this guy's a stalker, a serial killer, or just a nice guy trying to prove that she is worth something.</p><p>"Hopefully, it's the last one," Amy said.</p><p>They also pondered Tammy and Caleb's wedding plans, which included exchanging vows at the Ohio facility where they met.</p><p>"Don't make no damn sense because her whole family's down here," Chris expressed, though Amy explained the reason was that Tammy wanted the nursing home residents and staff to attend.</p><p>He then admitted that he would go along with the wedding but would "bombard" Tammy's fiancé with "questions, whether she likes it or not."</p><p>Amy appeared to soften her opinion on Caleb, confessing she's "willing to give him a chance," although she'd wish they'd "slow down" before rushing to the alter.</p><p>"We don't know this guy from the man on the moon, and you want to become our brother-in-law...give us time to get to know the bro.</p><p>"Why are you setting it in stone so fast? Don't do that," she said in a separate interview.</p><h2>WEDDING PLANS</h2><p>Elsewhere during the episode, Amy couldn't hold back her concerns for the bride-to-be after Tammy asked her younger sister to play a special role in the big day.</p><p>"You know how I was your maid of honor, wedding planner, whatever you want to call it? I wanted to know if you would repay the favor and do my wedding," Tammy asked&nbsp;<a href=#>over a video call</a>. "Be my maid of honor most of all."</p><p>However, Amy surprised her sister with some&nbsp;<a href=#>frank feelings</a>.</p><p>"It's awful soon, sis," she replied, referencing the quickie love story.</p><p>Amy tried to explain further: "I'm ready to do this for you. I am. It's just. I got a lot going on with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glenn and Gage</a>&nbsp;(her sons)."</p><p>But that excuse didn't sit well with Tammy.</p><p>"There will be a lot of people there to help you take care of the babies, including myself," she snapped back. "So I call bulls**t."</p><p>After a few tense moments, Amy agreed: with one warning.</p><p>"I’ll definitely be your bridesmaid," she conveyed. "I love you unconditionally."</p><p>"Now, I can't say that about Caleb 'cause I don't know him that well."</p><p>"You don’t have to get to know him," Tammy fired back, trying to stave off a fight. "I have to get to know him. That’s all that matters."</p><p>Later, in a confessional, Amy explained her reservations but also gave her sister her full support.</p><p>"No matter what concerns I have, no matter if I met Caleb or not, my sister is getting married, and I'm going.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it's her health and her happiness. But if I meet him and there's some red flags," she warned, "b***h, you ain't getting married."</p><h2>TROUBLE IN PARADISE</h2><p>Tammy indeed got married -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exchanging vows with Caleb</a>&nbsp;in November 2022.</p><p>However, Amy's concerns may have been justified, as The U.S. Sun recently revealed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the newlyweds are experiencing some setbacks</a>&nbsp;as they struggle with a long-distance marriage.</p><p>Shortly after saying, "I do," Tammy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">left her Ohio rehab center</a>&nbsp;to settle into her new&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kentucky</a>&nbsp;home, leaving Caleb behind.</p><p>A source has shared that tensions are building between the couple because of the distance.</p><p>Caleb had plans to transfer from the Ohio center to a clinic in Kentucky to be closer to his new wife, although a few obstacles remain in the way.</p><p>He has to make arrangements with his insurance to cover the transfer, but a source has revealed Caleb hasn't taken any initiative to do so yet.</p><p>The source claimed: "Tammy is sad her husband is not with her.</p><p>"She is frustrated Caleb has not made an effort to move to a facility in Kentucky from Ohio. They have been arguing because she feels he is not handling the transfer with urgency."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Because of the full house, Tammy says she's "pissed" that Caleb isn't around to help out, according to the&nbsp;<a href=#>1000-Lb.
