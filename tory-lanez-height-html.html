What’s truly baffling is that social media users could not stop talking and joking about Lanez’s height despite the situation’s gravity.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On August 20, 2020, Megan Thee Stallion claimed that the Canadian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rapper had shot her</a> at an after-party on July 12 in the Hollywood Hills. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Eventually, Lanez was arrested when the police found a concealed gun inside his vehicle. Nevertheless, he pleaded ‘’not guilty’’ and “strongly rejected” the allegations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lanez was later released after paying a bail of $35,000.&nbsp;</p><p>After a few weeks of the incident, Lanez responded to the allegations made by Stallion through a song, 'Queen And Slim.' The lyrics of the song went:&nbsp;</p><p>Me and Kylie still off in the pool. We was chillin’, kickin’ s—, was cool. Both of us didn’t know you was trippin’. Even though I got a crush on Kylie, I woulda left with you if I knew you was dipping for the simple reason. You invited me but I can’t act like shawty didn’t excite me I had took a wrong turn that-night.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, what made headlines on social media is something else entirely. Social media users took frivolity to the next level when they commented about Lanez's height and physical appearance.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The arrest report of Lanez shows his height and weight as 5 ft. 3'' and 120 pounds, respectively. People also joked about his real name, which is Daystar Shemuel Shua Peterson.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Lanez quickly became a social media gag as numerous memes got made around his height and appearance.&nbsp;In a video uploaded&nbsp;on the YouTube&nbsp;channel, HipHopdx on July 15, 2020,&nbsp; several memes directed at his appearance are compiled together.</p><p>In one meme that got viral on Twitter, a video of a huge figure is seen lifting a child by his jacket. The video was captioned: “Brahhhhh, they said this was the police taking Tory Lanez to jail.”&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Another tweet read: “Tory Lanez’s the same height as Calvin Cambridge.”&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In another stance, a video titled ‘When Tory Lanez stood up and was the same height,’ the rapper is seen rapping while sitting on a chair.</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, when he gets on his feet, his height looked no different. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>This video was also shared on Twitter with the caption “Can someone please explain how Tory Lanez stood up but didn’t get any taller” and a laughing emoji.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Well, trust social media to take the focus away from the main issue, sometimes!</p><h2>Update on the Megan Thee Stallion Case</h2><p>As of August 2021, things just look to be getting worse for the Canadian rapper.&nbsp;</p><p>A prosecutor&nbsp;ruled that he violated a protective order filed against him by Megan Thee Stallion.</p><p>The order required Lanez to stay 100 yards away from Megan Thee Stallion at all times. However, the prosecution claimed he broke this rule&nbsp;when he performed alongside <a href=# rel=follow>DaBaby</a> as a surprise guest at the Rolling Loud music festival.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8s8WMpZinnapitaa1xqGrZ6Ckork%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
