The “Believe” songstress, 76, stomped the runway in a skin-tight, cleavage-baring latex catsuit with jutting shoulder pads on Wednesday, September 28. In the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eye-catching pics</a>, the fashion icon wore her famous dark hair long around her shoulders in bouncy waves, and finished the futuristic bodysuit look with fingerless gloves and platform wedge boots. Of course, she brought the glam with a colorful makeup palette including blue eyeshadow and berry-red lipstick.&nbsp;The luminous singer beamed as designer <strong>Olivier Rousteing </strong>also took to the runway and embraced her onstage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cher-catsuit-milan-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The look is almost guaranteed to be imitated by stars and regular people alike, and according to a January 2022 interview, the so-called “Goddess of Pop” likes it that way. “I like it,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood veteran</a> and Oscar winner told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>. “I see all the young girls kind of wearing things that I’ve worn my whole life. They think it’s new or they see a picture and they love it, so they do their own version. Or they do my version. It doesn’t both me.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>And it turns out that Cher didn’t simply arrive on the scene as a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fully-fledged style icon</a>. In the same interview, she reflected on her earlier years as one half of the 1960’s & 70’s duo<strong> Sonny & Cher</strong>. “We had a look that people just really didn’t understand at all,” she recalled of her unique, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>boho-meets-glam look</a> at the time. “We were so proud of our look and our clothes, but we couldn’t get on a lot of shows. No one was doing what we doing. There weren’t stylists to take on people who were unknown or doing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>something really different</a>.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/cher-catsuit-milan-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>She also admitted that she keeps favorite fashion items around. “I have things that I’ve had in my wardrobe for 30 years,” she told the magazine. “The other night I was wearing my black bondage pants, and I’ve had those since I don’t know, Granny Takes a Trip,” (a popular ’60s boutique in London). “I don’t remember&nbsp;how&nbsp;long I’ve had them, that’s how long I’ve had them.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The stunning singer says keeping things in your closet can work out later down the line, when you’re looking for just the right thing to coordinate.&nbsp;“If you keep certain things, then you can bring them back, and if they’re good and they’re interesting, you can put them all together,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FxZpyglad6ra3Tnq9mm5GpwLa102aZmqSdlravedGupbCZqWK9or7IrGSfmaOdtrC6jLCcnqNdpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
