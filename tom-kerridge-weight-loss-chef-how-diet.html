Don't deprive yourself</h2><p>While Tom is all about eating healthily, he says it's important to let yourself have a treat once in a while.</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>: "There is nothing wrong with a flapjack in the afternoon when you get that 4pm lull if everything else is in place."</p><p>Tom also pointed to Anthony Joshua who has a honed physique - but still allows himself to have a burger and chips now and then.</p><h2>2. Go for a swim</h2><p>As well as diet changes, Tom began a rigorous swimming routine to help him lose weight.</p><p>He started setting his alarm to 6.15am every morning so he could go swimming at the hotel up the road from his house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000504468582.jpg><p>He said: “On a busy day I swim a kilometre; on a relaxed one I’ll do a mile.”</p><p>According to the University of California, Berkeley,&nbsp;swimming&nbsp;burns an average of 600 calories an hour, depending on the stroke and intensity.<br></p><h2>3. Make healthy swaps</h2><p>Tom believes that a big part of losing weight is about "arming yourself" with healthy alternatives.</p><p>This is so that when you're hungry, you aren't tempted to reach in the biscuit tin or gorge on a bag of crisps.</p><p>The Great British Menu star told The Spectator: "Celebrate the foods you can eat, instead of focusing on the ones you can’t. Have low calorie skinny popcorn next to you."</p><p>Tom particularly enjoys having apples and grapes as a snack now - instead of chocolate or biscuits.</p><h2>4. Ditch alcohol</h2><p>One huge change Tom made to his diet regime was completely ditching booze.</p><p>He told the <a class=body-link href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-vars-item-name=BL-8418341-https://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/f4tc9q/tom-kerridge-lose-weight-for-good/ data-vars-event-id=c6>Radio Times</a>: "I own pubs and, you know, I’m quite good at tasting. So I knocked all booze on the head. Stopped drinking, went completely teetotal."</p><p>Tom says he gave up alcohol not just to make sure he was cutting out liquid calories - but also to help get in a healthy mindset.</p><p>He told Good Morning Britain: "Drinking on diets isn't good – and that's on any diet. It's not a calorie thing or the sugar content, it's the mindset."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000058992355-e1581591169693.jpg><h2>5. Cut down on the carbs</h2><p>Tom says he became a lot more conscious of how many carbs he was munching on when he kickstarted his weight loss journey.</p><p>"Carbs are a big thing,” he said.</p><p>"The more you understand it and the more you look into it, you see that there are so many carbohydrates involved in sugar as well."</p><h2>6. Prioritise breakfast</h2><p>When he was at his biggest, Tom admits he used to regularly skip breakfast.</p><p>At the start of his day he would usually consume two pints of coffee and then snack later in the day on cheese on toast and packets of crisps.</p><p>However, he now makes sure he eats a hearty breakfast every day - eating things like overnight oats or omelettes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000529872358-e1581591059411.jpg><h2>8. Dopamine diet</h2><p>Tom has credited something called the <a href=#>dopamine diet</a> for helping him to blitz his body fat.</p><p>It involves boosting your levels of the so-called 'happy hormone' so that it's easier to stick to your diet.</p><p>There are different ways of doing the diet, however, all are based around food that is thought to boost dopamine levels in the slimmer.</p><p>Foods you're allowed to eat on the diet include unprocessed meat, dairy and dark chocolate, meaning that it doesn't overly restrict what you can eat.</p><p>Most versions of the diet recommend avoiding caffeine and processed sugar.</p><p>Tom, whose TV credits include MasterChef&nbsp; and whose Bucks gastropub The Hand & Flowers gained its second Michelin star in 2012, previously said he decided that he needed to change his diet during a moment of reflection around his 40th birthday.</p><p>"Say we live to 80. Well, I thought, I’m halfway there. And then, I thought … I’m not going to get there. If I’m like this, I’m not going to make it," he said.</p><p>Tom previously starred in Lose Weight ad Get Fit on BBC2 and has since starred in Remarkable Places to Eat with Fred Sirieix.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with <a href=#>The Guardian</a> he said he's lost a lot of strength during the pandemic as he doesn't have any free weights at home, but said he had taken up running to fill the exercise gap.</p><p>"I hate every minute of it. I’m not built for running but I try to do 20, maybe 25k a week. I make myself do it and I feel better when it’s done."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlgbn50f5VyZq2nnWK4pr7RopugnV2ssqqzx61kpaejqHqktMSfZKGnp2KxqrHTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
