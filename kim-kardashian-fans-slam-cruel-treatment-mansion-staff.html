This is literally Willy Wonka. Look at this, the whole tub is chocolate."</p><p>She seemingly made her Elf on the Shelf design for her four children: <a href=#>North</a>, 10, <a href=#>Saint</a>, eight, <a href=#>Chicago</a>, five, and Psalm West, four.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>GOING ELFING CRAZY</h2><p>In the following video, the <a href=#>Skims</a> co-founder continued to flaunt her chocolate-filled bathtub - but added more products into the mix.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Lying in the pool, large and small marshmallows were scattered around mixed with many small elves.</p><p>Where all the rest of the candy was, other elves sat by the mess along with a letter that was written in pink ink.</p><p>However, once fans took notice of the star's bathroom, they shared their thoughts on <a href=#>Reddit</a>.</p><p>One user shared screenshots of Kim's story and said: "Why did this make me mad? All this waste. Yes, that is a tub full of CHOCOLATE."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'CAN'T BE GOOD!'</h2><p>More fans shared their honest thoughts on the star's <a href=#>Christmas</a> idea.</p><p>"The poor staff that have to clean this," one person mentioned.</p><p>The author replied: "I think that’s why I’m so annoyed, because she certainly isn’t cleaning this up!"</p><p>A third said: "That&nbsp;cant&nbsp;be good for the plumbing."</p><p>"She’s not the one who thought of it, she’s not the one who set it up, and she’s not the one who’s going to clean it up. But she’s the one who’s gonna take credit for it," claimed a fourth critic.</p><p>A fifth pointed out: "I would SINCERELY hope they lined the tub with some kind of Saran Wrap before filling it with chocolate to protect the pipes and for cleanliness."</p><p>"&nbsp;Some people go so over the top. The food waste I cannot get behind in this economy," wrote a sixth.</p><p>"Much like any mess they make, they just wait for someone to fix it for them," someone else said.</p><p>"So cruel for her maids to have to clean this up," another commented.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>MORE DECORATIONS</h2><p>Kim is so stranger to <a href=#>going all out for the holidays</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, Kim revealed 15 <a href=#>giant snow-covered Christmas trees</a> located in the hallway of her <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> mansion.</p><p>A pianist could be heard playing holiday music in the background – a tradition the <a href=#>beauty</a> mogul has been carrying out for years, despite backlash.</p><p>The trees reach almost to the ceiling in her home as she keeps her decorations simple.</p><p>They did not feature lights or other decorations, only fake <a href=#>snow</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Kim's walking tour ended in her living room where the cream-colored piano could be seen.</p><p>Next to the piano was a white Christmas tree lit up with yellow-white lights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kim-kardashian-shows-off-elves-867686819.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kardashian-critics-slam-kims-unfair-765463110.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaWaGeHyXaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYrOiutJmqqWZnWKws8HEpWStqpWWwa6xza1kppmeqLawuoysq5qelmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
