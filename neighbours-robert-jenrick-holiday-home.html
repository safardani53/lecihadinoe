One of them is to deliver essential supplies to vulnerable people.</p><p>“Clearly if that is what Robert Jenrick has done, then it fits within the four exceptions. It is for him to answer precisely what the purpose of the journey he undertook was.”</p><p>Government guidelines say you should not visit family except if they need help, such as getting shopping or medication.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>On March 23 new instructions were issued warning people to stay at home and not visit second homes “whether for isolation purposes or holidays”.</p><p>It added: “People should remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000093935728.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000576164903.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Give now to The Sun's NHS appeal</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tp-composite-who-cares-wins-1.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>BRITAIN’s four million NHS staff are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus.</p><p>But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them?</p><p>The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £1MILLION for NHS workers.</p><p>The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.</p><p>We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid-19 Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.</p><p>The Sun is donating £50,000 and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.</p><p>No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here</p><p>www.<a href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal&source=gmail&ust=1586026721907000&usg=AFQjCNG02gQh1-TpDTj27ustTNMPQR-BLw" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-mce-href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-display/showROFundraiserPage?pageId=1157115">thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tp-composite-who-cares-wins-1.jpg><p><b>We pay for your stories!
