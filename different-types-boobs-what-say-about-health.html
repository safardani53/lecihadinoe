Even though it probably is not cancer, catching it early will improve the odds of survival.</p><p>Sarah had secondary breast cancer, which is when cancer cells spread from the breast to other parts of the body. At this point, it is no longer curable.</p><p>The signs of this are:</p><li>Feeling sick most of the time</li><li>Severe or ongoing headaches</li><li>A dry cough or feeling of breathlessness</li><li>Any lumps or swellings under the arm, breastbone or collarbone</li><li>Discomfort or swelling under the ribs or across the upper abdomen</li><li>Loss of balance of any weakness or numbness of the limbs</li><li>Pain in the bones which may worsen at night</li><li>Feeling more tired than usual</li><li>Altered vision or speech</li><li>Unexpected weight loss, loss of appetite</li><h2>3. Round</h2><p>If you have round breasts then they have an equal amount of fullness at the top and bottom.</p><p>People with round breasts usually have larger mammory glands and while this might be the desired look - they can cause a host of health issues.</p><p>A previous study, published in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Orthopaedics Journal</a> stated: "Breast-related shoulder-neck pain is thought to result from changes in the centre of gravity, and large or heavy breasts may lead to continuous tension on the middle and lower fibers of the trapezius muscle and on associated muscle groups."</p><p>Women with bigger breasts also experience issues such back and neck pain due to the extra weight they are carrying.</p><p>As well as this - many women with larger breasts struggle to find the correct size bra for them.</p><p>A 2013 study stated: "Increasing breast size and how a bra is worn may have biomechanical implications for the loaded thoracic spine and surrounding musculature."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to check for breast cancer?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>There is a five-step self exam you can do at home to check for any changes.</p><ul><li><strong>Step one:</strong>&nbsp;Begin by looking in a mirror, facing it with your arms on your hips and your shoulders straight. You should be looking for any dimpling, puckering, bulging skin, redness, soreness, a rash or changes in the nipple.</li><li><strong>Step two:</strong>&nbsp;Still looking in the mirror, raise both arms above your head and check for the same changes.</li><li><strong>Step three</strong>: With your arms still above your head, check for any fluid coming from the nipples. This can include milky, yellow or watery fluid, or blood.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Step four:</strong>&nbsp;While lying down use your opposite hand to check each breast. Using a few fingers, keeping them flat and together, go in a small circular motion around your breasts. Make sure you feel the entire breast by going top to bottom in these small circles. It helps to develop a system or pattern to make sure every inch is covered. Use light pressure for the skin and tissue just beneath, medium pressure for the tissue in the middle of your breasts, and firm pressure to feel the tissue at the back, feeling down to your ribcage.</li><li><strong>Step five:</strong>&nbsp;Feel your breasts while either standing or sitting, using the same small circular motions.</li></ul><h2>4. Bell shape</h2><p>If you have bell shaped breasts then they will be rounder at the bottom.</p><p>Experts say that this could cause a rash.</p><p>"Your breasts will rub against the skin on your abdomen, causing friction, moisture and heat.</p><p>"A sweat rash known as&nbsp;intertrigo, an infection caused by a yeast condition, will form.</p><p>"It will appear in the skin fold as red or reddish-brown, raw and itchy, cracked, and sore," experts at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BuglinoPlasticSurgery</a> say.</p><h2>5. Athletic</h2><p>If you have more of an athletic shape then it's likely you will have smaller breasts.</p><p>When it comes to your health, this could be a sign that you exercise or train on a regular basis which has benefits such as weight maintenance and a better quality of sleep.</p><p>If you have athletic breasts then it's likely they will be wider with more muscle and less breast tissue.</p><h2>6. <strong>Asymmetrical</strong></h2><p>People who have asymmetrical breasts usually have one bigger than the other and this is common.</p><p>This can be down to a number of things such as trauma, <a href=#>puberty</a> and hormonal changes.</p><p>Pregnancy is another condition which could mean your breasts change size.</p><p>Another medical condition includes atypical ductal hyperplasia which happens when the milk ducts in your breasts have excessive growth.&nbsp;</p><p>The condition isn't cancer, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">studies have shown</a> that it can increase your risk of of the illness in the future.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2>7. Tubular breasts</h2><p>If you have tubular breasts then they are usually the same shape from the base of the breast to the end.</p><p>While this is usually anything to worry about, in some instances they can cause people severe anxiety or stress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TM-graphic-BreastCheck-1.webp><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIJ6gZNqaHFnlJ6zp7HRnqWtZaSuvaa%2FjJumqJqjYsSprdNmqpqxXZavsMHTZp%2BemZyptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
