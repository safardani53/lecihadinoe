The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Real Housewives of New York City</a> star shared a new photo of herself showing off the fresh look while still sitting in the salon chair.

The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>beauty</a> also revealed that she got a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>neck and face lift</a> when she posted a before and after Instagram photo on July 20. “There’s been speculation around my fresh new look. I got a lower facelift and neck lift after wrapping Season 12,” she wrote in the caption for the post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I just wanted to be rid of the wrinkling on my neck and the jowels that were starting to form,” she continued. “People thought I was nuts because it was so subtle. But not to me! It was a no-brainer – gravity had taken its toll, I was also exhausted and I needed a ‘pick me up’.” Like with her latest pic, Sonja’s admission got a positive response from fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e5FtZqynnp%2BubrnOq56apl2drqq%2BjKaYpJ2fq7KzecGenaiqlWKup8DEq2SpoZOofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
