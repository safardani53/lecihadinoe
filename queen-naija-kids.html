In fact, you’d be hard-pressed to find up-to-date photos of the kids as she keeps her personal life pretty low-key.</p><p>But can you blame her? After all, she has spent most of her career defending herself against allegations of bad parenting — both from social media and her ex-husband.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Queen Naija and Chris Sails break up?

I heard stories. I heard rumors. With him going out to Kai [Cenat’s] party … some girl told me like he went downstairs in one of the yachts.”</p><p>Later, both Queen and Clarence subtly dismissed his claims on social media. However, neither of them responded to Chris’s comments directly.
