Seriously, we have to fix this. #CodeRedWineKelly.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#Blasphemy</a> 😩😩😩 …..I mean, maybe you haven’t had the right glass of Pinot Noir is all I’m saying. This calls for a winery tour! Seriously, we have to fix this. <a href=#>#CodeRedWine</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/C8JOAH4d4o</a></p><p>— Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) <a href=#>July 20, 2018</a></p><p>Not surprisingly, Morris readily <a href=#>agreed</a>, saying she was “open to a change of heart,” and the cute Twitter exchange soon had hundreds of comments.</p><p>In fact, The Voice alum <strong>Cassadee Pope</strong> wrote that she wanted in on the booze tour, despite already having a love for red wine.</p><p>And while many people agreed with Clarkson’s assertion that Morris just hasn’t had any good red wine yet, others identified with “The Middle” singer and said they also can’t stand Malbec and merlot. However, one thing most people readily agreed on is the need to see or participate in this wine tour in one way or another.
