The inflammation is the body's reaction to injury or irritation, and can cause redness, swelling and pain.</p><p>It is often described as a chronic condition and although sufferers will have periods of good health, there are flare-ups where symptoms are more active.</p><p>It can be caused by the genes a person has inherited, an abnormal reaction of the immune system and is probably triggered by something in the environment.</p><p>A few celebrities have gone public with their diagnosis, including magician Dynamo, real name Stephen Frayne, who shocked fans with his dramatic weight gain due to the illness.</p><p><strong>Common symptoms include:</strong></p><ul><li>diarrhoea</li><li>abdominal pain and cramping (usually worse after eating)</li><li>extreme tiredness</li><li>unintended weight loss or gain</li><li>blood in poo</li><li>mouth ulcers</li><li>inflammation</li><li>feeling ill</li><li>joint pain</li></ul><p>At first Ashley said she couldn’t accept having a bag.</p><p>“But when I realised a J-Pouch wasn’t working for me either because of all the leaking, I knew I had to go back to having a bag because I knew my quality of life would be so much better.</p><p>"I’ve had most of my colon, rectum, and anus removed, so doctors thought it was best to surgically close my buttocks. I look the same as everyone else, but there’s just no hole there anymore – it’s just like a Barbie bum.</p><p>"It’s completely transformed my life. Now, I want to be a positive influence and show that ileostomy bags shouldn’t be taboo."</p><p>When Ashley first started suffering with symptoms she said she was sick all of the time and couldn’t stop going to the toilet.</p><p>“One time, we were on a family road trip and I ended up using one of the children’s nappies as I needed to go so suddenly”, she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607067488.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607067490-1.jpg><p>Ashley lost 20 pounds over a 10 month period and her blood pressure dropped to dangerously low levels as her body was unable to retain nutrients.</p><p>After the initial operation it was confirmed that she had both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.</p><p>She said: “I hated the bag as soon as I saw it. I didn’t want to be reliant on it for the rest of my life.</p><p>"I was really low and felt ill all the time."</p><p>In 2017 she had the bag replaced with a J-Pouch.</p><p>This means people can go to the toilet normally without using a waste bag as it preserves the sphincter muscles and preserves the anus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607067497.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607067495.jpg><p>But Ashley was soon hit with additional side effects and said that there were occasions where during the night she would start leaking.</p><p>She added: “‘My husband was brilliant. He’d scoop me up, put me in the shower, and change the bed sheets, but I hated it and felt so embarrassed.</p><p>"I had to wear adult nappies and couldn’t do any exercise.</p><p>"It was really painful. I felt like a sick mummy. I wasn’t able to play with my children for fear of having an accident.</p><p>"But despite me having such low confidence, it actually made my relationship with my husband stronger.</p><p>“He was phenomenal. He was always there to take care of me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000607067496.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Ashley is now living with an ileostomy bag and she says her latest operation has made her feel empowered.</p><p>"Getting a bag for a second time actually made me feel empowered.
