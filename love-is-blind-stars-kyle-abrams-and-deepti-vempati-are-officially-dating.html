Deepti and Kyle discussed their emotions for one other during Natalie’s 80s-themed birthday party, which Danielle and Nick hosted. Kyle began by asking Deepti whether she was satisfied with the way things were between them, to which Deepti replied:</p><p>“Obviously, there are sentiments involved. You gravitate towards me in the same way that I gravitate toward you.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kyle-Abrams.jpg alt="Kyle Abrams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kyle informed Deepti she was the highlight of his life and went on to say:</p><p>“I’m overjoyed right now. I adore you and am really concerned about you. And whatever difficulties you have, they feel the same as mine… I simply want to build a relationship with you, like a real one. And be exclusive rather than simply being in limbo.”</p><p>Deepti asked Kyle if they were sure they were going to do it, and Kyle answered he was certain and wanted to. Despite his fears, the Love Is Blind actor chose to make things official with Deepti.</p><p>Kyle spoke out to People about why he was afraid to take their relationship to the next level at first. He stated:</p><p>“I placed a lot of pressure on myself because I didn’t want this to fail. I was afraid to intervene since she was my best friend.’ And if it doesn’t work out, you lose your buddy. Because if you split up for whatever reason — and I had no intention of breaking up — you always have to consider what comes next.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Deepti-Vempati.jpg alt="Deepti Vempati" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When asked whether things had changed since they first began dating, Kyle stated:</p><p>“After that, it was as if nothing had changed since I felt as if we were already dating.
