You don’t even know at the time that you’re only doing what you think people want you to do,” Knoxville told <a href=#>Vulture</a> in May 2018. “You’re just expending energy and not thinking about why. Eventually, I realized that you can’t give so much to this idea of who you’re supposed to be. I guess I’m realizing that with the stunts, too.”</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “You know, it’s like I loved&nbsp;[journalist] Hunter S. Thompson<span class=s1>&nbsp;</span>so much, and I couldn’t maintain that side of me, the side that was running wild in 2002, three, four, five. Nor did I want to. Also, I met my now-wife and I wanted to be a better person for her. Then I got into it and thought,&nbsp;‘I gotta be a better person for me, too.’ I’d never really thought like that before.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5iju7p5yqemsa6ZobmmecWio56rXZu8s3nDoq2oqpOaeqe%2BzqZkp5mforZuusSlqqimXZmyta3Ipapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
