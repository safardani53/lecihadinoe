After nearly a decade on the web, the Tampa, Fla. native is ready to make his mark in the city of his dreams — New York City.</p><p>Whether making fun of his fiancee in his videos or reacting to insane TikTok recipes with hilarious banter, Corey has proven exceptionally gifted at making people laugh. More recently, he has created a new lane as the go-to cooking hack king and is working on a cookbook of his favorite quick recipes. Did we also mention Corey boxes in his spare time?!</p><p>Distractify sat down with the jack-of-all-trades to discuss some of the “distractions” he can’t live without, and more!</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">If you had to get a tattoo right now, what would it be?</h2><p><strong>CB: </strong>Something that symbolizes New York. I'm in love with New York, and it's always been my goal and a dream to move here. I've been here for five years now.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">If you couldn't be an influencer, what would your dream job be?</h2><p><strong>CB:</strong> If I couldn't be an influencer, I'd still be doing a show. I would want to go the path that Ryan Seacrest went. I would love to host a late-night show. I would love to be in that realm.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What’s the best fan interaction you’ve ever had?</h2><p><strong>CB:</strong> I walked into this run-down in New Orleans, and a lady approached me at the jewelry thing. And she said, “Oh my God, I know who you are.” And my fiancee was in defense mode, and she was like, “Excuse me, how do you know him?” and she goes, “From the videos.” Still to this day, I mess with her about I'm like, “Remember when you got stank with that one girl that was trying to take a picture with me?” And she goes, “Yeah, just don't talk about that time.”</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What’s your most-used emoji?</h2><p><strong>CB: </strong>The typical basic crying laughing face (😭😭😭). I'm a basic b---h.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@billssupperclub; @iamcoreyb</span></figure><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What’s your favorite color?</h2><p><strong>CB: </strong>Black.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What’s your go-to karaoke song?</h2><p><strong>CB:</strong> Oh, "Big Butts" (aka “Baby Got Back” by Sir Mix-A-Lot).</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Tell us about the best meal you've ever had/favorite food.</h2><p><strong>CB: </strong>I just had butter chicken last night. I love butter chicken with garlic naan.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What's your dream collaboration?</h2><p><strong>CB: </strong>I saw someone collaborating with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cindy Crawford</a>, and I don't know if that's a dream for me, but I got jealous. I was like, “Cindy Crawford is doing videos with, like, influencers?” A part of me is like, I want to do a video with Cindy Crawford just because someone else did it.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Shout out one of your favorite fellow creatives!</h2><p><strong>CB:</strong> Shout out to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Koosh</a>. It's time to move out of your mom's house!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Corey B (@iamcoreyb)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Tell us about the first concert you ever attended.</h2><p><strong>CB: </strong>The first concert I ever went to was actually a Christian concert called Amberlynn. And it was Janice Landing in St. Petersburg, Fla. I didn't go to a concert until I was in high school. I was 14 or 15 [years old]. And there was a mosh pit for a Christian band, and I was freaked out. I didn’t want to get punched in the face praising the Lord!</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Who’s your celebrity crush?</h2><p><strong>CB:</strong> <a href=#>Eva Mendes.</a></p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">Share your top three desert-island necessities.</h2><p><strong>CB:</strong> An iPod loaded with music, sunscreen because I don’t want to get burned, and some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bang cookies</a>.</p><h2 class="sc-hYIrON gBHXty">What’s your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>CB:</strong> My son.
