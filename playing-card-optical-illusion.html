Maybe it has to do with the fact that some of us were raised on Where's Waldo books growing up, or those '90s optical illusion posters that had throngs of kids staring at a wall for a few minutes in an attempt to see a shark, astronaut, giant bowl of ice cream, or whatever-the-heck was supposed to be hiding behind an assortment of colors and designs that seem like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were definitely conceived during an acid trip</a>.</p><p>Sometimes there are multiple illusions packed in a single picture and depending on the first image a person sees, it's supposed to tell them something about their character. Of course, one could look towards their own actions/reactions to situations/people in their lives to discover that, but sure, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why not base your personality on a quick glimpse at a drawing instead</a>?</p><p>However, some illusions aren't "that deep" and instead exist in places that were probably right in front of our eyes for years. In the case of this particular one that's recently been making the rounds on social media, the illusion doesn't really have a hidden message or is supposed to hold a hidden secret about one's psyche. It's just a cool design choice that may or may not have been intentional.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>It all started with the design of the "8 of diamonds" in a deck of playing cards. There doesn't need to be anything special about the cards, you can literally grab any old 8 of diamonds from any standard deck and you'll be able to see this optical illusion.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram | @theycallmebeans</span></figure><p>The "illusion" lies in the negative space of the cards. The rounded edges of the diamonds on the 8 card also help to form a perfect number 8 within the diamonds.</p><p>Don't see it in the image above?
