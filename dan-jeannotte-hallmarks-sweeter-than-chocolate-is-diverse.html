You also get to see these snippets of a lot of different kinds of love stories.”</p><p>The Canadian actor, who plays journalist Dean Chase in <a href=#>the “Loveuary” film</a>, added: “I thought that that was so cute and fresh and it just brought energy to the movie and it makes it extra loving, extra sweet.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Dan-Jeannotte-Teases-Hallmarks-Sweeter-Than-Chocolate.jpg><p>Sweeter Than Chocolate, which premieres on Saturday, February 4, follows Dean as he investigates a fabled chocolate shop — and chocolatier Lucy Sweets (<strong>Eloise Mumford</strong>) — for producing magical cupid treats that bring the consumer true love.</p><p>Lucy and Dean’s possible happily ever after, however, is just one of the tales that play out on screen in the <a href=#>Valentine’s Day</a>-themed movie.</p><p>Jeannotte told Us on Tuesday that it was evident while filming how Hallmark Media has evolved in recent years to <a href=#>represent all types of happy endings</a>.</p><p>“That’s the other thing about these kinds of other love stories [that] we get to see within this, movie, is that they’re diverse,” <a href=#>the Bold Type alum</a> teased. “<a href=#>[We’re] seeing gay love stories</a>, love stories with people who met later in life, older people who fell in love after having a marriage or losing a partner. And it just goes to show there [are as] many different ways to fall in love as there are different people in the world.”</p><p>The former Reign star also gushed over Hallmark’s dedication to <a href=#>depicting all walks of life on screen</a>. “I think it’s so important that networks [and] writers are telling these kinds of stories. I’m so happy that Hallmark is doing that now,” he said. “It brings me a lot of, of joy and of, I just, I feel good to be amongst people who are telling these diverse kinds of stories.”</p><p>Jeannotte first joined the Hallmark family in 2015 with a role on Good Witch. He has since starred in numerous films for the company, including 2022’s The Royal Nanny. When asked to pick his “favorite” network project, however, the actor had a hard time choosing.</p><p>“I’ve been pretty lucky with Hallmark. [I’ve had] great movies with great people. And also, I’ve been really lucky to shoot in some really lovely locations,” he told Us. “Honestly, and I’m not just saying this because this is the movie I’m promoting now, [but] this movie <a href=#>is my favorite of the Hallmark movies</a>.”</p><p>The Paris, Wine & Romance actor revealed that Sweeter Than Chocolate has a “beautiful script” and a “beautiful energy” throughout. “It’s really well developed and beautiful,” he said. “It’s my favorite one.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sweeter Than Chocolate premieres on Hallmark Channel Saturday, February 4, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuapl2fsqK6zairrZ1dna6tuMyaqaSrXajEprHTnqlmrJiWu26vx6iaqKSRqbJutdJmm6KulafApns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
