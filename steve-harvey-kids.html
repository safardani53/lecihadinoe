The former standup comic will be heading his own courtroom-based reality show, <a href=#>Judge Steve Harvey</a>, in which Steve uses his life experiences to arbitrate a variety of conflicts.</p><p>But while Steve is a household name today, he has had a long road to success. Along the way, he’s been married three times and to date, the funnyman has a total of seven children. So, just who are Steve Harvey’s kids?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span><p>Jason Harvey, Amanda Harvey, Broderick Harvey Jr., Brandi Harvey, Marjorie Harvey, Steve Harvey, Lori Harvey, Karli Harvey, Wynton Harvey, Morgan Hawthorne, and Kareem Hawthorne</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Steve Harvey’s kids?</h2><p>Steve Harvey’s first wife was Marcia Harvey. Together, they had two daughters and a son. The children were very young when their father left their mother to pursue his comedy career and admittedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t have a relationship</a> with him until later in their lives.</p><p>Today, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandi</a> is a successful businesswoman and activist. She runs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Her</a>, which encourages women of color to embrace an active lifestyle to elevate their mind, body, and spirit. She’s also a published author who in 2019, released a self-published self-help book called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Breakthrough Sold Separately: Get Out of the Boat of Mediocrity and Walk on Water</a>.</p><p>Brandi’s twin sister, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karli</a>, got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married in 2015</a> and thankfully by then, her relationship with Steve had healed sufficiently that he walked her down the aisle. Karli and her husband, Benjamin Raymond, welcomed their son BJ in 2016.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Broderick Harvey Jr. (@bharv)</a></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broderick Harvey Jr.</a> was 3 years old when his parents officially split, although unlike his sisters, he hasn’t been as public about his relationship with his dad. However, it seems like father and son are on good terms as according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WeAfrique</a>, Broderick manages social media for The Steve Harvey Radio Show and is also part of the Product Development and Brand Integration team at Steve Harvey World Group.</p><p>Steve’s second marriage was to Mary Lee Harvey and lasted 10 years. The couple had one son in 1997 named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wynton</a>. Having graduated from Savannah College of Art and Design, Wynton is a professional photographer and occasional model. You can purchase prints by Wynton on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p><p>Steve’s third and (so far) last marriage was to his longtime friend, Marjorie Elaine Harvey. Marjorie had three children from a previous marriage but when she married Steve in 2007, Steve adopted all three of them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lori Harvey (@loriharvey)</a></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan</a> is the oldest of the three and along with being a happy wife and mother, she’s also a professional baker.

The youngest Harvey daughter has been in a number of high-profile relationships with people like Sean “Diddy" Combs’s son, Justin, and rapper Trey Songz. The successful model’s current relationship is with Black Panther’s Michael B. Jordan and seems to be quite serious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmwsRmn5qqpprGbrfInao%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
