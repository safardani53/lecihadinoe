We’re not sure just how long these two have been hanging out since this is the first time Celina publicly showed off a pic with the hunky blond singer but they definitely seemed to be pretty comfortable with each other!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Despite the intimate hangout, Aaron’s rep told us that he “is single and dating and currently looking for the right girl.” His rep also said that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in regards to Celina</a>, Aaron said that “not everyone who comes into my life is meant to stay.” Hmm…So perhaps these two are still getting to know each other or maybe they were just down for a night of casual fun? We’re not entirely sure but it did look like they were having a good time!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Celina and Aaron’s surprise hangout comes at a time when Celina’s been in the headlines a lot lately. The social media star has been involved in a scandal with <strong>Snoop Dogg </strong>after she claimed the rapper allegedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cheated on his wife</a> and had an affair with her. She even released supposed private text messages between her and Snoop that allegedly shows they had intimate conversations together and privately met up at hotels. Snoop hasn’t admitted to any wrongdoing though and with Celina’s history of admitting she made up the scandal in which she claimed <strong>Offset</strong> was the father of her pretend baby, it’s easy to understand why there’s doubt in her claims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aaron-carter-celina-powell-embed-01.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/aaron-carter-celina-powell-embed-02.jpg alt="Celina Powell, Aaron Carter" width=750 height=1624 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Regardless of any past drama, we hope Celina and Aaron continue to have fun together.
