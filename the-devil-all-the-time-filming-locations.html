The script takes place in rural Ohio, however, the filming actually took place across the state of Alabama.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Most scary movie fanatics are anticipating an influx of horror releases around Halloween, but Netflix's latest psychological thriller, <a href=#>The Devil All The Time</a>, arrives a few weeks before on Wednesday, Sept. 16. The trailer shows teenage Arvin Russell (played by Tom Holland) receiving his late father's gun for his birthday. There are flashbacks to his father (played by Bill Skarsgard), who fought in the war, which shows the family has an incredibly dark past.</p><p>The new thriller (and the 2011 book it's based on) takes place in the midwest, however, the filming locations for The Devil All The Time are much further south. Stay tuned for more regarding where the upcoming movie was actually filmed, but first, take a look at the trailer (and make sure your doors are locked before doing so!).</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Although the story takes place in the midwest, 'The Devil All The Time' was filmed down south.</h2><p>The author of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Devil All The Time</a>, Ronald Day Pollock, intended for the story to take place in the remote town of Knockemstiff, Ohio, and various parts of West Virginia. And although the movie supposedly takes place in those locations, that wasn't where it was filmed. According to LatLong, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shot throughout different cities in Alabama</a>, including: Anniston, Pell City, Birmingham, Dora, Wetumpka, Jacksonville, Montevallo, and Riverside.</p><p>LatLong tagged each location on a map. In addition to various streets, a few spots you can visit from the movie include City Of Lights Dream Center, Forest Park, Oak Mountain State Park, The Ark, and The Peerless Saloon and Grill. According to Al, the actors laid low during production, however, Robert Pattinson (who plays a priest) was spotted at Birmingham's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shu Shop</a>, and Tom Holland posted a photo from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Topgolf</a> during his downtime.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Robert Pattinson spotted in Alabama this past weekend #TheDevilAllTheTime #tomholland #robertpattinson #sebastianstan #billskardgard #rileykeough #jasonclarke #miawasikowska #douglashodge #haleybennett#abbyglover#HarryMelling ðŸ“¸ @mattgiddens.dwg @el_banjo121</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Devil All The Time Movie</a> (@thedevilallthetime_) on Mar 25, 2019 at 12:55pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In addition to impeccable casting, the movie has a wildly talented crew behind the cameras.</h2><p>While Tom Holland, Bill Skarsgard, and Robert Pattinson are only a few familiar faces you'll recognize while watching Netflix's latest masterpiece, the behind-the-scenes crew is also comprised of true Hollywood legends. For example, the filmmaker of well-regarded creations Simon Killer and Christine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Campos, will be running the show</a> as the film's director, while Donnie Darko star, Jake Gyllenhaal, is among the movie's extensive list of producers, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>The 2011 novel of the same name was incredibly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">well-reviewed by the New York Times</a> following its initial release back in 2011. The NYT book critic at the time, Josh Ritter, referred to the authors' prose as "sickly beautiful," so it seems as though the writing â€” as well as the story itself â€” makes for a seriously compelling watch.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>We're beyond nervous (and hyped) for The Devil All The Time to haunt our dreams, but we're definitely looking forward to a new quarantine movie to obsess over while the self-isolation continues. That being said, even after watching that spooky AF trailer, we'll probably be sleeping with the lights on for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecOeraKkXZa5rXnToZxmrJmism6yyKWkoqaXYrmwr8CtoKimow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
