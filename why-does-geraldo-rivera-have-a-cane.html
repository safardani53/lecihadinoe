The journalist went to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, N.Y. back in 2010 to have surgery done on his back. When he emerged, he realized that the surgery had been botched and that his right foot was severely affected, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Malpractice and Injury Lawyer Blog</a>.</p><p>This surgery left him unable to "jog, play tennis, ski, or even keep up with his 10-year-old daughter." Naturally, Geraldo pursued legal action against the hospital, alleging malpractice during the surgery that caused his foot to cease functioning correctly. He filed a lawsuit in the state of New York and the hospital vehemently denied any wrongdoing in the case.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>They alleged that Geraldo's foot injury was not a result of the surgery on his back but instead the product of him slamming his foot into a refrigerator while undergoing rehabilitation.</p><p>Nonetheless, Geraldo underwent surgery to attempt to rectify his foot problems on New Year's Eve 2013. He hasn't spoken much about the situation in the years since it transpired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Geraldo Rivera's net worth?</h2><p>Foot injuries aside, Geraldo has worked tirelessly over the last few decades as a public figure and thanks to such, has amassed quite an impressive net worth.
