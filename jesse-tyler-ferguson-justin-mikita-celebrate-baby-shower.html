Thank you, but shh, don’t tell anyone. Let’s just keep it between us.”</p><p>When host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>James Corden</strong></a> asked what the couple are having, the Emmy winner simply said, “A human.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ferguson and Mikita got engaged in 2012 </a>after dating for nearly two years. Later that year, the Broadway star told Us Weekly what it was like to have Vergara’s engagement occur around the same time.</p><p>“I told Sofia the day before she got engaged,” Ferguson recalled. “Very quietly, I said, ‘Justin and I got engaged, but we don’t want to tell a lot of people and we don’t want to upstage you on your big birthday weekend’ — and then the next day she gets engaged on a Tulum ruin! So she upstaged us.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One year later, Ferguson and Mikita <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wed in New York City</a> in July 2013.</p><p>Scroll down to see pictures of Ferguson and Mikita’s baby shower.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2F0p5krbGcmr9ussSrnq6rn6N6q8HSraCnZZ2euKrAwGaanqSVl7%2BiwMRmmZqaqWLAqbvWnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
