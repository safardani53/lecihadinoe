It was the first public relationship for Colton after he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came out as gay</a>&nbsp;in an April 2021 interview with&nbsp;Good Morning America. The former football player posted Jordan on his Instagram page for the first time in December 2021 to celebrate his boyfriend’s birthday. Since then, the couple have routinely documented their romance on social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>In a Dec. 2021 interview</a> with&nbsp;People, Colton said that he “wasn’t&nbsp;really pursuing dating” until he met Jordan. “I’m the luckiest person to have him in my life,” he told the outlet. When he came out, Colton revealed that he<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> had suicidal thoughts</a> while he was still in the closet. “I&nbsp;would’ve rather died than say I’m gay,” he told <strong>Robin Roberts</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Colton was previously in a relationship with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cassie Randolph</strong></a>, the winner of his 2019 season of&nbsp;The Bachelor. After their relationship ended by May 2020, Cassie was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>granted a restraining order</a> against Colton after she filed court documents that accused him of stalking her. Cassie claimed that Colton had attached a tracking device to her car, showed up to her home and her parents’ home uninvited, and sent her harassing text messages. She later&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dropped the restraining order</a>&nbsp;altogether, and Colton <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>apologized to Cassie</a> during his&nbsp;GMA&nbsp;interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5FxZpynnKm8r3nUp5ueqqekvKV5xKeemp%2BVmXqju9ifqaKdnpl6q7vRnZinZZKnvLi6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
