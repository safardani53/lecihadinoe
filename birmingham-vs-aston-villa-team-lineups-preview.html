Steve Cotterill is their third manager since then.</p><p>Gianfranco Zola took Birmingham dangerously close to the relegation zone before resigning in April to make way for former Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp.</p><p>He kept the club up but was sacked in mid-September following a poor start to the campaign.</p><p><strong><a href=#>BET £10 GET A FREE £30 BET WITH SUN BETS</a></strong></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>The lineups and key stats for Aston Villa's battle with Birmingham</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003627132141-e1509115914745.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000318829674-e1509116146862.jpg><p>With Birmingham just above the drop zone, Sunday’s game has plenty riding on it. Our friends at <a href=# rel=noopener>Football Whispers</a> preview the match...</p><h2>Key battle: Maikel Kieftenbeld v Conor Hourihane</h2><p>Irish midfielder Hourihane joined the Villans from Barnsley in January and has quickly become one of the most important players in Bruce’s squad.</p><p>The 26-year-old, who came to England when he joined countryman Roy Keane at Sunderland, has been a revelation this season, scoring five and supplying another assist.</p><p>His fine form since moving to Villa Park was recognised internationally in March when he made his Ireland debut in a friendly against Iceland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000347379782-e1509115637709.jpg><p>Stopping Hourihane will be key to Birmingham’s chances of success. Central to achieving that will be Dutch midfielder Kieftenbeld.</p><p>The 27-year-old, who joined the Blues from FC Groningen in 2015, should start at the base of midfield with one of David Davis or Craig Gardner – previously of Villa.</p><p>Kieftenbeld has averaged 1.8 tackles per game this season – second only to Gardner of Blues’ midfielders – and makes 1.4 interceptions, which is more than any Birmingham midfielder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000361671297.jpg><h2>Potential match winners: Che Adams and Jonathan Kodjia</h2><p>Three years ago Birmingham City attacker Adams was plying his trade for Ilkeston Town in the Northern Premier League – the seventh tier of English football.</p><p>But in November 2014, then Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough signed Adams on a two-year deal for a reported six-figure fee.</p><p>Adams repaid his manager’s faith and quickly took to league football, scoring 12 times in 41 outings during the 2015/16 campaign to earn a £2m switch to Birmingham last summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000320987677.jpg><br><p>This season Adams has bagged four from seven appearances in all competitions in a struggling side and will be pivotal to unpicking Villa’s defence on Sunday.</p><p>There has been no scrabbling in the lower leagues for gems for Aston Villa, however. The Villans went big in backing di Matteo and Bruce last term with mixed results.</p><p>One resounding success was the £15m capture of Kodjia from Bristol City. The Ivorian scored 35 goals in two seasons at Ashton Gate and carried that form with him to the Midlands, bagging 19 in his first season with Villa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003600545761.jpg><h2>Managers’ tactics</h2><p>Blues boss Cotterill, who was Redknapp’s assistant last season before leaving over the summer, is going into just his third game at the helm.</p><p>The former Bristol City, Portsmouth and Nottingham Forest manager has set his side up in a 4-2-3-1 system so far with three attacking midfielders supporting Isaac Vassell – cousin of former England and Villains star Darius – as the lone striker.</p><p>Villa, meanwhile, set up in a flat 4-4-1-1 with Tottenham loanee Josh Onomah in support of the striker – either Kodjia or Scott Hogan.</p><p>On the flanks, Robert Snodgrass and Albert Adomah get wide and stretch the play with Glenn Whelan holding the fort in midfield.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000361688908.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FOOTBALL</h2></p><h2>Likely lineups</h2><p>After winning his first game in charge 1-0 against Cardiff City, Cotterill was brought back down to earth with a 2-0 loss at Millwall in his second match and could ring the changes.</p><p>Chelsea loanee Jeremie Boga was benched for that tie along with former Brentford playmaker Jota who is making his way back from injury. The duo could return to the side in place of Cheikh Ndoye and Jacques Maghoma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/birmingham-xi-v-aston-villa.png><p>After beating Fulham 2-1 last weekend there is little reason for Bruce to meddle with a winning XI.</p><p>Left-back Neil Taylor is suspended so Alan Hutton should continue there. Henri Lansbury (knee) and Gabby Agbonlahor (calf) will miss out.</p><p>Jack Grealish and Mile Jedinak have both returned to training but the game should come too soon for the pair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/aston-villa-xi-v-birmingham.png><h2>Key stats</h2><p>Aston Villa relish playing their local rivals. In the last 12 meetings between the two sides the Villans are unbeaten in 11 with the solitary Blues win coming in a 2010 League Cup meeting at St Andrew’s.</p><p>The last time Birmingham won a league encounter was in the Premier League in March 2005. Bruce was in charge then and oversaw a 2-0 success with goals from Emile Heskey and Julian Gray.</p><p>What might give the hosts cause for optimism is the absence of long-serving Villa forward Agbonlahor. In 10 games against Blues he has scored five times and lost just once.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2mEeX6PbGdompmnuqq6xqGYpmWmqHqiv9OopWaumaG5onnTnpimZZyeu6bBz6xkqaqVq7amw44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
