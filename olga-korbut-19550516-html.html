Nicknamed the "Sparrow from Minsk", she won four gold medals and two silver medals at the Summer Olympic Games, in which she competed in 1972 and 1976 for the Soviet team, and was the inaugural inductee to the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1988. While Korbut retired from gymnastics in 1977 at the age of 22, which was considered young for gymnasts of the period, Korbut's influence and legacy in gymnastics was far reaching. Korbut's 1972 Olympic performances are widely credited as redefining gymnastics, changing the sport from emphasising ballet and elegance to acrobatics as well as changing popular opinion of gymnastics from a niche sport to one of the most popular sports in the world.</p><table class=wikibox readability=3><tr><td class=wk_label>Full name</td><td class=wk_value>Olga Valentinovna Korbut</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nickname(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Sparrow from Minsk</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>May 16, 1955, Hrodna, Byelorussian SSR, Soviet Union</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Discipline</td><td class=wk_value>WAG</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Club</td><td class=wk_value>Soviet Army Grodno</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Head coach(es)</td><td class=wk_value>Renald Knysh</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Eponymous skills</td><td class=wk_value>Korbut flip</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Retired</td><td class=wk_value>1977</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/olga-korbut-d2xo-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Gymnast Olga Korbut was born on May 16, 1955 in Grodno, Belarus (She's 68 years old now).</p><p>Soviet gymnast who won Olympic gold medals at the 1972 Munich and the 1976 Montreal Olympic games, for the Team, Balance Beam, and Floor Exercise events.</p><p>All information about Olga Korbut can be found in this post.
