The Spanish-German actor is married to former model Felicitas Rombold — and together, they are parents, too. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>While they never declared their wedding — <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speaking&nbsp;</a>to&nbsp;Entertainment Inquirer&nbsp;in June 2020, Brühl disclosed he got married to Rombold during the filming of season one of&nbsp;The Alienist, i.e., between 2016 to early 2018.</p><p>The actor stated, “I got married during Season One [of&nbsp;The Alienist]. That was the only holiday they [show creators] gave me.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Together, as a couple, they&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed</a>&nbsp;their first child, a son named Anton Hanno, in 2016.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ez-10 class=ez-video-placeholder-marker></span><p>The&nbsp;Good Bye, Lenin!&nbsp;star had also earlier <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>, while talking to&nbsp;Town & Country&nbsp;in July 2020, that he and his wife were expecting their second child.</p><p>Without criticizing the first season, obviously with her [Rombold] being a mother and me being a father of a little boy and expecting our second child to be born very soon, we were very touched by it.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>The power couple, who have been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">together</a>&nbsp;since 2010, are often snapped together, as well. Brühl posts their adorable pictures repeatedly on his Instagram handle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On October 14, 2019, the actor took to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;to share a candid snap with his wife, where he lovingly wrote, “Thank God she’s still laughing at my silly jokes.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And while many recognize Rombold for being the wife of Brühl, she has had a thriving&nbsp;career&nbsp;of her own.&nbsp;</p><p>Rombold, also a German native, is an accomplished psychotherapist who&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">completed</a>&nbsp;her B. Sc. in Psychology from the University of Potsdam in 2008. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Following her B. Sc. in Psychology, she served as a student research assistant at the same university until September 2008.</p><p>To continue her education in M. Sc. in Psychology, she enrolled at Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Germany — she completed her course in 2011.</p><p>Interestingly, it was when she was pursuing M. Sc. in Psychology in 2010; she met her now-husband, Brühl. At that time, the actor had just moved on from his long-time relationship with his fiancée, Jessica Schwarz. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking </a>with&nbsp;Page Six&nbsp;in January 2018, Brühl opened up that his psychotherapist wife helped him prepare for his role of Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychologist, in the series&nbsp;The Alienist. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>My wife is a psychotherapist, so that was pretty handy. Before we went to bed, I would ask her questions…She had her moments of, ‘Would you leave me alone?’ But she was very helpful.</p><p>Rombold had also tasted success in her stint as a model - she appeared in various high-fashion magazines.</p><p>Besides that, Rombold has a keen interest in traveling, which led her to travel to different counties. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According </a>to&nbsp;Heavy, she extensively traveled across Europe while pursuing her academics and modeling career. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnpJ2ybrLApZqopl2Wu6V506GcZq%2BZo8GmvoyspqWcmZq%2Fbq3CraarZZSWu6qxy2aZq62YocBuw8ifnGaho2KubrzSspqhp6SdsrOtz6KqrWWbo7y4eceiqmavmZuybq%2FAq5yeql2ptaa10WajqK6VYrmqssRnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
