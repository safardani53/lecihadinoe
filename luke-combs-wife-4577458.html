He’s had a steady rise to fame over the years, and his wife, <strong>Nicole Combs </strong>(née Hocking), has been there through it all!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Nicole and Luke met just as his career was first taking off in country music, so she’s been by his side through the wild ride into the spotlight. She is the ultimate supporter and is always with her husband on tour, at award shows, and more. Plus, some of Luke’s most romantic songs, including “Beautiful Crazy,” are about Nicole.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Learn more about Nicole and Luke’s relationship below.</p><h2>How Did Luke Combs and His Wife Meet?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Luke-Combs-Nicole-Hocking-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before officially meeting, Nicole and Luke moved to Nashville around the same time and knew of each other through mutual friends. However, it wasn’t until the Key West Songwriters Festival in May 2016 when they first connected. They were introduced by mutual friends while attending the event. When they got back to Tennessee, they reconnected when Luke asked Nicole out to dinner. By September, just four months later, they had made their relationship official.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I didn’t have anything going on when we met,” Luke admitted in 2020. “I didn’t have a record deal, or a publishing deal, or anything.” Meanwhile, Nicole was working seven days a week at two different jobs at that time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Luke proposed to Nicole in November 2018 after more than two years of dating. However, the proposal didn’t go&nbsp;exactly as planned. Luke wanted to propose to Nicole on the day they moved from an apartment in Nashville to the home they bought. He had purchased new collars for their cats with their updated address, and he was planning to put the engagement ring on one collar and surprise Nicole with it when the cat jumped on her lap.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Unfortunately, a stressful day of moving had the cats all riled up. When Nicole and Luke finally got to the house at 11:00 p.m., the animals had to be bathed and cleaned, so there was no hope for the secret collar move working. However, Nicole’s parents were flying in the very next day to celebrate the pending engagement, so Luke knew he had to pop the question that night.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“After I gave them their baths and everything, he was like, ‘OK, I got these collars for the cats with the new address,’ and he was like,’ And I also got you this!'” Nicole recalled on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Couple Things</a> podcast. “And he went into the kitchen and pulled [the ring] out and got down on one knee and the whole thing. I black out, I don’t remember this. I wasn’t expecting it at all. Not in the least bit. Especially not in that moment!”</p><h2>When Did Luke Combs and Nicole Hocking Get Married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Luke-Combs-Nicole-Hocking-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>After more than a year of being engaged, Nicole and Luke tied the knot on August 1, 2020, in Southern Florida. Hurricane Isaiah threatened to ruin the big day, but luckily, it went off without a hitch.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“Yesterday was the best day of my life,” Luke gushed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> at the time. “I got to marry my best friend. “I love you, Nicole Hocking. Here’s to forever.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I had a pretty solid feeling that I was going to cry,” Luke later admitted about his wedding day. “But I didn’t know I was gonna cry that much, but I did. I was like doubled-over crying guy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The wedding took place on the beach, and was smaller than expected due to COVID-19. Luke revealed that he and his bride had to cut 70% of their guest list due to the coronavirus regulations put in place at the time. “At the end of the day, that ended up not mattering because it was still really beautiful and it was really everything that I wanted it to be,” he gushed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Luke shared footage from the wedding in his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>music video</a> for “Forever After All.” The video shows the two getting ready to walk down the aisle, exchanging rings at the altar, and kissing on the beach with the sun setting in the background after the ceremony. There are also sweet moments from the reception, including their first dance, and the moment they stuffed their wedding cake into each other’s mouths.</p><h2>What Is Nicole Combs’ Job?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Luke-Combs-Nicole-Hocking-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Nicole went to Florida Gulf State University and received a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. When she first met Luke, she was working at Broadcasting Music Inc. in Nashville (BMI) as a recruiting coordinator. On the weekends, she was bartending to make some extra cash.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“I’d work at BMI Monday through Friday, and that’s the music industry, so you’re not making that much money,” Nicole recalled. “And then I was bartending Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So I didn’t have time to go on the road or take days off really. That was when we were just starting out.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Luke’s career took off pretty quickly after that, and by 2019, Nicole was able to join him on the road.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>“I quit BMI last year,” she said in May 2020. “And went on the road with him full-time and here we are! We’ve gotten used to living in small quarters together!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>A typical day for the pair involves “waking up, eating, working out” and a nap for Luke, according to Nicole. “We kind of make the best of it!”</p><h2>Does Luke Combs Have Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Luke and Nicole have two children together. Before they had kids, Nicole revealed that she and the country star were planning to start a family one day. “Yes, hopefully!” she gushed in an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Q&A. “I want a big family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>They started their journey in 2022, announcing that they were expecting their first child that January.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Luke took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to share photos of his and Nicole’s maternity shoot, which featured them holding up their baby’s ultrasound. “Here we go y’all!” he wrote. “Lil dude Combs is coming this spring! Couldn’t be more excited to start a family with this babe. It’s gonna be a hell of a ride.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Nicole and Luke welcomed their baby boy<strong>, Tex Lawrence Combs</strong>, in June 2022. Their firstborn is named after Luke’s great uncle (Tex) and Nicole’s father (Lawrence).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/luke-combs-with-his-wife-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-24>Nicole confirmed Tex’s birth with a Father’s Day post on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “It’s going to be hard to top this past Father’s Day,” she gushed. “Welcome to the world Tex Lawrence Combs. You are the best chillest angel boy and I am so happy I was chosen to be your mom. These are the days.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>In his own post, Luke <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>added</a>, “[We] are over the moon in love with this little guy. Mama and baby are healthy and we’re back home now with family. Life is good.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>The lovebirds didn’t waste much time before going for baby number two. In March 2023, they confirmed that they had another little one on the way. In a joint <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> post, Nicole and Luke shared that they would be joining the “2 under 2” club. “Baby boy #2 coming this September!” they added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>On August 31, 2023, the couple shared a joint Instagram post <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announcing the birth</a> of their second child, <strong>Beau Lee Combs</strong>. &nbsp;“8.15.2023 – Beau Lee Combs. Welcome to the world. We couldn’t love you more,” they captioned a video of a baby hat, pacifier, and note with his name and birth date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uuop5lk6S6o7%2BMsKCfnV1pgniDk25vaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
