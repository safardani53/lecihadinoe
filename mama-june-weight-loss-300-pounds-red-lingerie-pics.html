In the trailer, Mama June explains her apprehension about being a pageant girl, “I’ve been always on the other side of the pageant world, I don’t have any talent,” she says. We’re sure Honey Boo Boo will teach her the ropes, after all she’s a former child pageant star herself.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The show will also highlight Mama’s relationship with her&nbsp;ex-husband <strong>Mike “Sugar Bear” Thompson</strong>. Sugar is now remarried and things between him and Mama aren’t so friendly. The estranged couple will be seen arguing over visitation with Alana and legal battles in court. As if the season two couldn’t be any more juicy, Mama June is rushed to the hospital for an undisclosed “medical emergency” and it appears in the trailer that she even goes into surgery.
