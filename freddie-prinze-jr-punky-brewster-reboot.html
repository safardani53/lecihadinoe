And he said, ‘Hey man, I know you don’t like to work, but this is in LA, and they really like you and I think you should check it out!'” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Freddie explained</a> in an EXCLUSIVE interview with HL.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>He continued, “So, I read the script, because of Brian, and he said I’d love <strong>Soleil [Moon Frye]</strong> — he’s known her their whole lives because they’re both child actors — I loved it, and I went and met Soleil, really liked her, and they offered me the show and it was in LA and I said yes!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Freddie added that it was important to “get to see my kids every night at bed” and “every morning for breakfast,” which this role in the&nbsp;Punky Brewster reboot allowed him to do. The revival of the ’80s sitcom follows Punky (Frye), now a single mother, as she tries to get her life back on track with her three kids. When Punky meets Izzy (<strong>Quinn Copeland</strong>), a young girl in the foster care system, she’s reminded of herself. Freddie is set to star as Travis, Punky’s ex-husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Freddie-Prinze-Jr-mega-post.jpg alt="freddie prinze jr." width=464 height=790 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“It’s amazing. I’m telling you I started singing the theme song from the original show when I was reading the script and didn’t even realize this dude still knew all the words!” the&nbsp;Scooby Doo&nbsp;star gushed. “I hope I get to make a whole bunch of seasons of it because really funny and fun.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Freddie spoke to HollywoodLife in partnership with is with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kelley Blue Book</a> to reveal not only the 2021 Best Buy Awards, a complete list of the top 2021 car models in 17 major categories, but to also unveil Kelley Blue Book’s very own island within the popular Nintendo Switch game, Animal Crossing!&nbsp; “This is for young people, for grownups, or maybe you just don’t have a lot of confidence in car buying, but you can be an active learner and go to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>kbb.com</a> to find the right vehicle at the right price!” Freddie explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The exclusive island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, KBB.com HQ, will be accessible to fans to explore now through 12/17 from 3pm – midnight ET.
