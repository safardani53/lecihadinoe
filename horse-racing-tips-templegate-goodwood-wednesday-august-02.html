He ran his best race for a while when a close-up second at Beverley last time and the booking of Oisin Murphy catches the eye. He goes on any ground and won’t be far away.</p><p><strong>KYLIAN (3.00 Goodwood, nb)</strong></p><p>He has improved with every run and can take another step forward here. He broke his maiden at Newcastle before Ryan Moore took over at Sandown for a fantastic six-length success. He showed loads of pace over this trip and should be capable of better again.</p><p><strong>WESTERTON (1.50 Goodwood, treble)</strong></p><p>He has improved with every run this season and followed a Sandown success with a close-up third at Newmarket last time. That was over 1m2f and he should improve for this longer trip. He handled some give in the ground when a close second at Ascot.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £5 Get £20 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Bet UK: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets and Bonuses</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>William Hill: Bet £10 Get £40 in Free Bets (MOBILE ONLY)* </strong>- <strong></strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only.

He goes on any ground and has improvement to come.</p><p>Amleto has had just three runs and was a comfortable Chester maiden winner over this distance when last seen in May.</p><p>He looks on a fair weight and enjoyed the mud on the Roodee so the rain around isn’t a worry.</p><p>Tagabawa gives the impression there’s more to come although he was below par at Newmarket latest. Moving back up to this trip is a plus for him.</p><p>Struth has been knocking on the door and was just collared late on at Ascot over this distance 18 days ago.</p><p>The handicapper has left his mark alone so he’ll be right there again.</p><p>Clan Chieftain is interesting on handicap debut following a wind operation. He won a maiden over shorter but should improve for this stamina test.</p><p>The Goat is another running in this grade for the first time. He improved at Kempton last time and looks on a fair weight.</p><p>2.25</p><p>WHITE MOONLIGHT is lightly raced for her age and comes here in excellent form after taking Listed contests at Musselburgh and on the all-weather at Chelmsford.</p><p>This specialist trip suits and Saeed Bin Suroor and Oisin Murphy have a good partnership.</p><p>Breege looks a big danger after her superb second in the Sandringham Handicap at Royal Ascot.</p><p>That was over a mile but she has enough pace for this shorter distance.</p><p>Fast Response is best with some cut in the ground as she showed when a fast-finishing second in Chester Listed race 18 days ago. A repeat of that would take her very close again.</p><p>Jumbly is dropping in class after good runs at The Curragh and in the Duke of Cambridge at Royal Ascot.</p><p>They were over a mile but she’s arguably better over this trip and handles any ground. She’ll be right there under Ryan Moore.</p><p>Guineas seventh Olivia Maralda won at Epsom before going close in the red-hot Jersey Stakes at Ascot. This trip is ideal but quicker ground would suit.</p><p>3.00</p><p>KYLIAN has improved with every run and can take another step forward here.</p><p>He broke his maiden at Newcastle before Ryan Moore took over at Sandown for a fantastic six-length success.</p><p>He showed loads of pace over this trip and should be capable of better again.</p><p>Big Evs looks a huge threat having blown his rivals apart when winning the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p><p>The ground was quick there so that’s a slight concern on what’s sure to be slower going. But if he handles that, he’s a massive player.</p><p>Shagraan has been doing well over a furlong further, including when a tight second in a Newbury Listed last time.</p><p>He has plenty of pace so should make his presence felt.</p><p>Baheer didn’t have a lot to beat last time but did it without having to hit top gear.</p><p>He’s another dropping back in trip but trainer Richard Hannon knows what it takes to win this race having scooped the past two renewals.</p><p>Barnwell Boy won easily on debut here so will have no issues handling the track.</p><p>He was well beaten by Big Evs at Royal Ascot when he was kept out the back for too long.</p><p>William Buick is a decent booking and he should have him closer to the pace here.</p><p>Hackman was six lengths behind the tip at Sandown but it was still an excellent effort.</p><p>There’s no reason why he’ll turn the form around but a repeat could see him in the frame.</p><p>Purosangue was backed when fifth in the July Stakes at Newmarket last time. The step up to six furlongs didn’t help there and he’ll be happier over this trip.</p><p>He needs to improve to figure while Markakol’s form looks way short of this level.</p><p>3.35</p><p>INSPIRAL looks a big price to get the better of rising star Paddington for Frankie Dettori and the Gosdens.</p><p>While she has to give weight to the three-year-old favourite, she gets 3lb back for being a filly and has already won a Group 1 against the boys.</p><p>She ran a cracker when a neck second in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot and handles any ground.</p><p>Paddington has been well backed and has a massive chance of landing seven wins on the spin.</p><p>He kicked off the season winning the Irish 2,000 Guineas before taking the St James’s Palace Stakes at the Royal meeting.</p><p>He only had half a length in hand over Emily Upjohn when winning the Coral-Eclipse and she didn’t frank the form at the weekend.</p><p>Dropping back to a mile should help and he has won on soft and good ground. He’s the right favourite but is a very short price in his toughest race yet.</p><p>The others have a big gap to bridge with Aldaary running a decent second in the Summer Mile at Ascot 18 days ago.</p><p>He will have to show a lot more to win this but trainer William Haggas is in decent form.</p><p>Chindit has been far from disgraced in Group 1s on his past two starts but had to drop into Listed level to land his last success.</p><p>He was beaten five lengths in this 12 months ago and it should be a similar story today.</p><p>Charyn was third in the St James’s Palace but blotted his copybook at Deauville afterwards.</p><p>4.10</p><p>FLORA OF BERMUDA ran a cracker when sixth in the Queen Mary at Royal Ascot last time.</p><p>She was first past the post on the disadvantaged far side of the track after travelling strongly and staying well.</p><p>Her pace will be an asset on this sharp sprint track and there shouldn’t be any issue with the draw this time. She’ll go close under Oisin Murphy.</p><p>Harvanna deserves this step up in class after winning a hot novice contest at York before confirming that form at Yarmouth 21 days ago.</p><p>Dapperling has been busy but never runs a bad race and was a good second in the Super Sprint at Newbury last week.</p><p>She is suited by this trip and can be relied on to go well again.</p><p>Indispensable was beaten in a tight finish at Naas when the drop back to this distance suited.</p><p>She likes a little cut in the ground and handled the track well when second here in May. She is on the shortlist for William Haggas.</p><p>Tropical Island looked very green when winning on debut at Ripon 11 days ago.</p><p>She didn’t get the clearest of runs either so did well to come out on top.</p><p>Richard Fahey is in decent nick and there should be a lot more to come.</p><p>Beenham was a winner over this course and distance in May and put in a good effort when sixth in the Super Sprint.</p><p>She has plenty of pace and could hit the frame.</p><p>Make It Easy didn’t have a lot to beat at Catterick last month but she did it nicely.</p><p>This is tougher but the Channon yard has had plenty of success at this meeting down the years.</p><p>4.45</p><p>DECORATION has improved with every run and followed a Windsor maiden win with a close second on her handicap debut there.</p><p>Roger Varian’s daughter of Frankel has a lot more improvement to come over what looks an ideal trip.</p><p>La Isla Mujeres had seven lengths in hand when scooting in at Salisbury 18 days ago.</p><p>She relished the soft ground there and even an 11lb rise in the weights may not put the brakes on.</p><p>Chips And Rice has improved since moving to James Fanshawe and landed a smooth success at Brighton last month.</p><p>This is tougher but a 6lb rise is fair and she has place prospects.</p><p>Queen Regent makes her handicap debut for the Gosdens after three promising efforts at maiden level.</p><p>She has yet to run on turf but will appreciate this trip and should run well under Oisin Murphy.</p><p>Value Added runs for the King and got the better of Queen Regent at Wolverhampton last time. There doesn’t seem to be a lot between them.</p><p>Therapist has been in good form at Newmarket with a win and third from her past two runs.</p><p>The handicapper has left her mark alone which gives her a chance.</p><p>Persist carries the same colours and is better than we saw at Newcastle last time where she badly missed the break.</p><p>She’s shown decent form over this trip and her best would give the William Haggas filly a chance.</p><p>5.20</p><p>RHOSCOLYN has form at Goodwood in stronger races than this over this trip and has come right down the weights.</p><p>He ran his best race for a while when a close-up second at Beverley last time and the booking of Oisin Murphy catches the eye. He goes on any ground and won’t be far away.</p><p>Farasi Lane could be drawn better but comes here on the back of a good win at Ascot.</p><p>He likes this trip and won’t mind if there’s more rain.</p><p>Darkness is another coming here after winning, this time in decent company at Newmarket.</p><p>He was beaten in a photo here in June so we know handles the track.</p><p>Dark Thirty dropped back to 6f for a decent third at Newmarket but is better over this trip. He has gone well here before and is a fair 2lb above his last win.</p><p>Classic saves his best for this distance and had a bit more than a length in hand when scooting in at Sandown 25 days ago.</p><p>He’s up just 2lb for that which gives him every chance.</p><p>Urban Sprawl was a winner over course and distance in May and was an excellent third in the Britannia Stakes at Royal Ascot. He is up the weights but can’t be discounted.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Thunder Ball was fourth in the Britannia latest but is equally effective over this distance.</p><p>He’ll have to find more from his rising handicap mark but has an each-way chance.</p><h2>Templegate's tips</h2><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
