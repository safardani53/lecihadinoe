However, she explained that all of the work she put into the business&nbsp;was just beginning to reward her.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, she had also considered that&nbsp;having a baby at this point in her career might bring all of that to a screeching halt.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Tami Roman Wanted Her Husband's Legacy to Live On</h2><p>Then again, Roman did not want her husband to bear the brunt of her decision. On the contrary, she believed that Youngblood being an only child, wholly deserved the opportunity to further his legacy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So, Roman made her husband an offer. She suggested that Youngblood take a break from their marriage for "a year or two" to find a woman with whom he could have a child.&nbsp;</p><p>When he had his child, he could come back to Roman, and they could reignite their marriageâ€”pick up where they left off.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Would&nbsp;Tami Roman Raise the Child with Her Husband?</h2><p>The next question on everyone's mind was if Roman was willing to raise the baby that her husband had&nbsp;outside of their marriage.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Roman confidently replied that she was a firm believer in co-parenting. Therefore, she would not only help Youngblood raise his baby, but she would let&nbsp;the child's mother be in on it too.&nbsp;</p><p>It was just that she was not willing to have the baby on her own, nor was she willing to go through the entire surrogacy process and have her eggs extracted.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It's really more about him being able to have his legacy here. Because he's an only child and he doesn't have any children, so it's really more for him than it is for me.</p><p>As for what Roman will be up to during those&nbsp;couple of years when&nbsp;her marriage would be on hiatus, she confessed that she would not entertain any other man in her life.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>How Did the Husband React?</h2><p>With all that being said, as open as Roman was to this idea, her husband was not on-board. Instead, he was adamant that Roman was the woman he fell in love with.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>He believed that&nbsp;if God had put him in the relationship and God did not want him to have children, then that was how it would be.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Hearing her husband's selfless response, Roman felt as though it was a blessing and a curse at the same time. While she was happy that her husband loved her beyond measure, she was also aware that she had introduced a selfish element into their relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyRorZuvs6mmKdlmKrAo63NnWSbmZKue6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
