He has not only assisted the Avengers in their struggle against Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, but he has also shown his abilities as a superhero in other parallel realities.&nbsp;Strange Tales #113 was the first to feature the character (1963). Strange made his television picture début in 1978. Years later, Marvel Studios considered casting this character in the MCU, which is where the wizard first appears on the big screen.&nbsp;Doctor Strange fans all across the world have their own beliefs about this superhero. In this article, we will discuss four such fan ideas that will astound you.</p><h2>Four fascinating Doctor Strange fan theories</h2><p><strong>1) Fans believe Multiverse of Madness will be a sequel to Avengers: Infinity War.</strong></p><p>Many MCU fans and die-hard Dr. Strange fans believe that the sorcerer’s second solo film will focus on the aftermath/repercussions of his actions in Avengers: Infinity War (2018).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Doctor-Strange-2.jpg alt="Doctor Strange" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Some fans who have seen the trailer believe that the opening words “It was the only way” plainly allude to Dr. Strange’s dialogue with Iron Man in Avengers: Infinity War, and that there must be some link between these two films.</p><p><strong>2) MCU fans believe that Dr. Strange set the groundwork for the Eternals to arise.</strong></p><p>A segment of the Marvel fandom thinks that Strange was the one who prepared the way for the Eternals to appear onscreen. Perhaps their notion stems from the wizard’s knowledge of the eventual ending of Avengers: Endgame, in which the Avengers would finally remove the gauntlet from Thanos.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Doctor-Strange-3.jpg alt="Doctor Strange" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to fans, Strange purposefully caused the “snap” to occur in Infinity War and then put things right again in Endgame in order to bring everyone back for the Eternals.</p><p><strong>3) Doctor Strange will assist Wanda in recreating Vision in the Madness Multiverse.</strong></p><p>Fans are certain that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness will assist the Scarlet Witch in recreating her love interest, Vision. Perhaps they believe that since the wizard still possesses a duplicate copy of the mind stone in the Eye of Agomotto, he will be able to assist Wanda in Vision’s rebirth.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Doctor-Strange-4.jpg alt="Doctor Strange" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>4) Doctor Strange wished for the snap-in Endgame to occur.</strong></p><p>This one, too, caught us off guard. A part of the MCU fandom believes the wizard intended for the famous “snap” to occur. They said that the wizard had his own reasons for believing that Thanos, Hulk, Thor, and Vision should not exist in the future.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidqK2iYravwNGinq6hnpx6pbvCraarZaOpv6K6xp5kn5meYsGpsc6roJ6rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
