(The exes — who share daughters North, 9, Chicago, 5, and sons Saint, 7, and Psalm, 4 — <a href=#>called it quits</a> in 2021 after more than six years of marriage).</p><p>In addition to their romantic bond, the “Flashing Lights” musician and Censori have a professional relationship, with the latter serving as the Architectural Designer for YEEZY since 2020.</p><p>“Bianca complements Kanye on so many levels and he loves that they can work and <a href=#>collaborate together</a> on projects,” the first source tells Us. “He appreciates and respects her opinions, even if they don’t always agree. She really keeps him grounded and he’s feeling better than ever.”</p><p>Although West has moved on romantically, his contentious coparenting relationship with his ex-wife, 42, has been referenced on the season 3 of <a href=#>The Kardashians</a>, which premiered last month.</p><p>“Even through all of the craziness — of everything that Kanye says about us — I never comment. I never post. He has made up the most insane narrative about you and [my sex tape] and we stay silent. We stay silent through all the lies and all the stuff,” the SKIMS cofounder told mom <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> during the season premiere.</p><p>She added: “I think at this point, I just assume everything I text Kanye is going to be on the internet. I think I can handle anything. I just get really heartbroken from my mom — that she has to deal with so much, you know, from so many different sides of people coming at her.”</p><p>The KKW Beauty founder was referencing the Grammy winner’s September 2022 <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram rant</a> in which he claimed that Kris, 67, made Kardashian and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> do Playboy shoots.</p><p>“Hollywood is a giant brothel. Pornography destroyed my family. I deal with the addiction [and] Instagram promotes it. Not gonna let it happen to Northy and Chicago,” West wrote at the time. His Instagram account has since been deactivated.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although the former couple have had their <a href=#>ups and downs</a>, Kardashian is supportive of the fashion designer’s new relationship.</p><p>“Kim is actually <a href=#>glad that Kanye has found someone</a> that makes him so happy,” a third source exclusively told Us in March. “She knows they have both completely moved on from their relationship and she wants nothing but the best for him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZ6usm7DxKyrZpmemXqjtcCnmpplk5q7tLvRoqpmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYrCwwcudpa1lkpp6o7HTrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
