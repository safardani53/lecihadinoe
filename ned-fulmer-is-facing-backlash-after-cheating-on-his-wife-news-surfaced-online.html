However, this has yet to be verified.&nbsp;The rumors of the affair intensified when fans observed that Ned Fulmer was not in any of The Try Guys’ latest videos or podcasts.

Herring collaborated with the ensemble on a series of videos promoting the film The Shallows. In an interview, she described her experience working with them as follows:</p><p>“I was a huge Try Guys fan. I was overjoyed. During my first week there, I was strolling around receiving a tour of the facilities when I realized, ‘Oh my God, it’s Keith…’ And the guys are fantastic and hilarious. It was great to see them in their environment, and nothing seemed staged.”</p><p>Alexandria Herring has over 49.4k Instagram followers. She often exhibits her trips and promotes films created by The Try Guys.
