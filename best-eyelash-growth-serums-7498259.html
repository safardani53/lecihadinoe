Same goes for mascara from time to time (flakes, smudging — the works). An easy way to avoid the chaos and the wasted time? Invest in a high-quality eyelash growth serum that will give you the doll-like lashes of your dreams. Whether you have sparse or thinning lashes or simply want to see how much longer your flutters can grow, lash serums are an enticing way to enhance your natural features. “With consistent daily use, they can boost growth of new hair, thicken, lengthen and even darken existing hair,” says Dani Vincent, celebrity makeup and brow artist and founder of Kimiko Beauty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In search of the best serums on the market, we at PEOPLE Tested tried 30 different lash serums to see which ones actually worked and which ones you can leave behind. After taking them home and testing these serums for ten weeks, we found that nine of the products were really worth the lash-lengthening hype.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to discover your new bedtime (and/or morning) ritual that may just give you your prettiest lashes yet.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-revitalash-cosmetics-advanced-eyelash-conditioner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RevitaLash Cosmetics Advanced Eyelash Conditioner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RevitaLash Cosmetics Advanced Eyelash Conditioner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pA7GGT7_CrvDSs2DBGtSgHJ4v4w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revitalash-advanced-eyelash-2e45beda35f74580bf096adc1d30fdb7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This serum basically doubled our lash length in just one month.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The formula is as thin (and non-irritating!) as water.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Our lashes felt much stronger and less prone to breakage.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We weren’t sure what to expect when we started using what would soon become our favorite lash serum over at PEOPLE Tested, but we approached the whole idea with a bit of skepticism. That is, until we became acquainted with the RevitaLash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner (which also happens to be one that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meghan Markle</a> previously used). This physician-engineered serum has been reviewed by both ophthalmologists and dermatologists, taking a bit of the worry away from putting this serum so close to our eyes. To our shock and amazement, we noticed eyebrow-touching lash growth in just one month that had people stopping us to ask if we got extensions (side note: this had never happened before).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Its thin, barely-there formula feels merely like water and dries quickly, leaving the conditioning components of peptides, biotin, lipids, and more to soak into our lash follicles and stimulate gradual growth. Though we were applying this serum once per day for ten weeks, we saw our lashes nearly double in length over the course of just a month, all the while becoming thicker and less brittle as a result. We do wish that we spurted a few more hairs than we had to begin with (we noticed it worked wonders on our existing lashes but didn’t generate any new ones, though the brand does not claim that it will help incite new growth), but we couldn’t be happier with the results we did get. The price is high, but this product delivers on its return, so we couldn’t recommend it more (keep your eye out for a sale to make this serum even sweeter).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Biopeptin complex, ginseng, swertia japonica, saw palmetto, amino acids, B vitamins | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.67 oz. | <strong>Application frequency:</strong> Once daily (AM or PM)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-maybelline-lash-sensational-boosting-eyelash-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline Boosting Eyelash Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maybelline Lash Sensational Boosting Eyelash Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/P_RhU1vJ2pL9UPg_1LiodWSkeSs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maybelline-lash-sensational-serum-d35b321be97f41bdbbc7b2c5a669a2fc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>Despite the drugstore price, this lash conditioner still delivered noticeable results.</p></li><li readability=1><p>Our lashes became glossier, thicker, and overall better-conditioned.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The bristle applicator makes this serum easier to use.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever looked at a lash serum brush and thought to yourself, “What do I do with this?,” then you’ll be happy to discover that our best budget pick from Maybelline is made with a bristled wand that applies like a mascara, feeling second-nature to even total newbies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved how glossy and luscious this serum made our lashes look as we swiped it on and noticed a visible change in the volume of our lashes after ten weeks of testing. Its composition of arginine (a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>protein-building amino acid</a>) and pro-vitamin B5 helped to strengthen each individual lash and keep them from becoming brittle, which is super helpful if you’re an avid user of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lash-curler</a>. And if you’re looking for a bit of lengthening in addition to healthier lashes, this pick from Maybelline’s got you covered, too. We think this serum is your best bet for a budget pick while still getting the luscious lashes you desire — just be sure to wipe the excess product off of the wand before applying it to your lashes because it can get a little goopy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Arginine, pro-vitamin B5 | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.18 oz. | <strong>Application frequency:</strong> Twice a day (AM and PM)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-brows-and-eyelashes-grande-cosmetics-grandelash-md-lash-enhancing-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Brows and Eyelashes</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Grande Cosmetics Lash Enhancing Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH MD Lash Enhancing Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/MEZ2Yj7dbdejn-uFc_ARaMSXPco=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/grande-cosmetics-grandelash-md-lash-enhancing-serum-d4f484510347431388b6cea2e435fdc0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plucking pandemonium may have left you with über-thin eyebrows in the past, but this lash-enhancing serum from Grande Cosmetics is here to not only strengthen your lashes, but rescue your brows as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chock-full of powerhouse ingredients like peptides, amino acids, and hyaluronic acid, this serum acted fast on our hair follicles, drying down within 20 seconds of application and giving us thicker strands by the end of our ten-week trial. We saw a noticeable difference in the volume of our eyebrow hairs specifically, improving the fullness and density of our brows in addition to strengthening our lashes (though there was less of a lengthening effect here).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will note that it stung a bit when excess serum got into the corners of our eyes (which was only enhanced by wearing contacts at the time), so we advise you to be sparing with the serum and avoid eye contact. The product’s instructions advise you to swipe on the serum above your lashes like a liquid liner instead of applying it directly onto your lashes — so keep that in mind as you apply.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Amino acids, hyaluronic acid, grape seed extract, honey, aloe vera extract | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.07oz. | <strong>Application frequency:</strong> Once daily (AM or PM)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-eyes-lancme-cils-booster-lash-revitalizing-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Sensitive Eyes</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lancôme Lash Revitalizing Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lancome Cils Booster Lash Revitalizing Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3uf6MKtCt7ghgpyE-sjmLI3aOgQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lancome-cils-booster-bd89986270e443e388a99b164fe0eccd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>This serum played nicely with all of the other steps in our nighttime routine, including our eye cream.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We noticed far less eyelashes naturally falling out after using this serum.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>There were absolutely no reactions or irritations experienced as a result of this product.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It can be daunting to put a serum right next to your eye, so it’s important to invest in one that won’t irritate your eyes or make the growth process painful. The Cils Booster Lash Revitalizing Serum from Lancôme has mastered sensitive eye-safe formulas, causing us zero irritation or reactions after using the product for months (and one tester had pre-existing eczema on their eyelids, which says a lot about the gentle nature of this serum). Its fast-drying formula doesn’t drip into the eyes and requires just one dip into the tube to glide over both eyelids, coating each lash line evenly. It worked well with our nightly routine of eye creams and other potions, and truly did lengthen and thicken our lashes over time, as we noticed far less lash loss than we did before using it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Between being fragrance-free and boasting a nourishing chemical cocktail, this serum came out of our trials on top for both performance and sensitivity. Our only qualm? We wish the tube had a flat bottom, so we could display the pretty gold product with the rest of our go-to nighttime skincare.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Amino acids, arginine, panthenol | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.13 oz. | <strong>Application frequency:</strong> Twice a day (AM and PM)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Cindy Mathieu</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-anti-aging-vichy-liftactiv-serum-10-eyes-and-lashes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Anti-Aging</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vichy Eyelash Growth Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Vichy LiftActiv Eyelash Growth Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6aUcFma6qc2uSNikD2t7hYnOtHU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vichy-LiftActiv-Eyelash-Growth-Serum-22a7472821264cbdb3ddbaef59e82c8e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Skin Texture</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This serum felt cooling on our eyes and spread easily onto our skin.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We noticed that we lost far less lashes while removing makeup at night than before.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Its smoothing ingredients stimulate the lash follicles and work to reduce the appearance of fine lines or wrinkles around the eyes</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love a product that can do it all (or at least serve several purposes in one small bottle), which is why we love this eyelash growth serum that doubles as an anti-aging product. It's packed with rhamnose (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>a plant sugar that aids in the preservation of skin structure</a>), hyaluronic acid, and volcanic water, which reinforce your skin barrier (and contributes to this serum’s water-like texture) — all contributing to the growth of your lengthy lashes and suppleness of your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After several weeks of testing, we noticed a significant change in the fullness of our lashes, especially when it came to our bottom lash line. We found ourselves no longer losing as many eyelashes as we removed our makeup at night and loved the cooling effect that was left as we dabbed this serum onto our eyelids before bed, acting as a luxurious final step in our nighttime routine. People with mature skin and younger skin alike will both benefit from this serum in their daily lives, whether it be for more luscious strands, preventative measures, or anti-aging purposes, as this serum really does it all. We just wish it came in a brush or wand format rather than a pump, because we fear wasting too much product (a lot comes out in one pump). This product is simply too good to lose out on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key ingredients:</strong> Rhamnose, pure hyaluronic acid, volcanic water | <strong>Size:</strong> 0.51 oz. | <strong>Application frequency:</strong> Twice a day (AM and PM)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Emma Phelps</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-quick-results-rapidlash-eyelash-enhancing-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Quick Results</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RapidLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta RapidLash Eyelash Enhancing Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dvojlzJnzV83rlS7C5qYF9Xm6U4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/RapidLash-Eyelash-Enhancing-Serum-d7940984e39e416f81ecf245dc1b4a38.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Strengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Lengthening</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sensitivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>We didn’t experience any gloppiness or serum dripping into our eyes.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Our lashes physically and visibly grew in strength and length.</p></li><li readability=0><p>This serum was super comfortable to wear, even on sensitive eyes.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In today’s digital age, we’re all about instant results — which can cause a bit of impatience while waiting for a lash serum to finally start showing result. But this speedy-fast iteration from RapidLash was able to deliver visible results in just a few weeks, cutting our original ten-week testing period down significantly in terms of physical changes. We loved how gentle this serum was while still working hard to generate longer lash growth, as our testers have sensitive eyes yet experienced zero discomfort when it came to this product.

Peptides and amino acids are great for targeting the hair follicles, which stimulates growth and leads to longer, stronger, and fuller lashes. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Lian Mack also recommends ingredients like biotin, water soluble B-based vitamins, amino acids, and polypeptides to stimulate your hair’s keratin production. Her go-to recommendation for over the counter serums is <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">RapidLash’s Eyelash Enhancing Serum</a>, because it “contains polypeptides to limit breakage, panthenol to nourish, and amino acids to fortify proteins.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, there are definitely ingredients that you should be avoiding to preserve the health of your eyes. Lipids known as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>prostaglandins</a> and prostaglandin analogues are at the top of Dr. Mack's "no" list. She explains how prostaglandins are molecules that were first used in ophthalmology as a treatment for glaucoma and originally thought to stimulate eyelash growth. But today, researchers have discovered that this type of chemical, or synthetic versions of it (prostaglandin analogues) have been linked to a myriad of issues around eye health. “With consistent use, individuals may develop upper eyelid ptosis (drooping), deepening of upper eyelid (fat shrinkage), increased blood vessel formation, and darkening of the eyelids and under eye area,” Dr. Mack explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For your safety, we ensured that all of our winners were free from bimatoprost, a well-known (and previously popular) prostaglandin. However, we encourage you to always check the ingredients yourself, as formulas are often subject to change, or confirm with your doctor that the serum you want to try is safe.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Results</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The end result (and time frame you wish to achieve it in) is another aspect that you should take into consideration when picking the right eyelash growth serum. Some serums are best for lengthening, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Borboleta Lash Serum</a>, whereas others are more proficient with thickening, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Velour Lashes Long & Strong Lash Serum</a>.

However, the use of any products with prostaglandins is definitely something to be wary of (read: completely avoid) during pregnancy. Since prostaglandins are hormone-like substances, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Cleveland Clinic</a>, and using products with this type of lipid can affect existing pregnancies or create health issues along the way. However, both Dr. Mack and Vincent agree that peptide- and vitamin-based formulas are more than acceptable for people going through a pregnancy who still want to try out a version of a growth serum. Though all of our picks are free from the main original prostaglandin in lash serums, bimatoprost, we encourage you to check with your doctor before starting a product like this during pregnancy.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested these eyelash growth serums in our daily lives for a span of ten weeks to get the full results of these too-good-to-be-true products.
