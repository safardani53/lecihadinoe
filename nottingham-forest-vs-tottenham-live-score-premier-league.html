His team are now without a win in six and have managed just one victory in 13 games.</p><p>While Cooper still has the firm support of Forest’s fans, you get the feeling that owner Evangelos Marinakis could press the big red panic button at any time.</p><p>Spurs certainly made hard work of this win but Richarlison clearly enjoyed his moment celebrating in front of the home fans.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW TO GET FREE BETS ON FOOTBALL</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-sun-22-23-match-stats-f85316f8-04f7-46c1-bc55-300c353f4a93.png><p>To score in a third game in succession would even be sweeter as he faces former club Everton at home next Saturday.</p><p>Even ahead of the trip to the east midlands, Postecoglou spoke about Richarlison saying that for the first time this season, he is injury-free and playing with a clear mind.</p><p>Yet if he is to continue his run, he needs a few more stunning passes from Kulusevski.</p><p>What a player he is proving to be and it is no surprise he has created more chances than any other player for Postecoglou this term.</p><p>While that £50m deal for Richarlison may still not be seen as great business, the £29.2m for Kulusevski was a bargain.</p><p>Although it was a hard-fought win, it was a <a href=#>deeply disappointing return for Brennan Johnson</a>, who was back at the City Ground following his £47.5million deadline day move to Spurs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/richarlison-tottenham-hotspur-scores-teams-866541653.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-tottenham-hotspurs-dejan-kulusevski-866546447.jpg><p>He suffered a head injury after just over 30 minutes and as he walked off the pitch holding tissue over a cut head, he received a standing ovation from the home fans along with chants of ‘he’s one of our own’.</p><p>Johnson, who scored 29 goals for Forest, came close to grabbing only his second for Tottenham when he prodded the ball towards the corner but Turner got down low to push the ball away.</p><p>Son Heung-Min should have put Spurs at the start but fired a surprisingly-tame shot straight at Turner after a terrific pass from yes, you’ve guessed it, Kulusevski.</p><p>Yet despite being in control, Spurs started making silly mistakes and giving the ball away with Pape Matar Sarr a key culprit.</p><p>Cheikhou Kouyate should have made the most of some chaos in the Tottenham area but somehow, he missed a free header and embarrassingly, he ended up handling the ball instead.</p><p>Johnson then suffered a whack to his head in a challenge with Willy Boly and after overcoming the rough patch, Richarlison delivered that glancing header from six yards following the terrific cross from the right by Kulusevski.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/helped-medical-staff-suffering-head-866539697-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/c8f2f368-6751-4175-8518-29a421522ea8.jpg><p>Boly, though, could at least have put in a challenge on Richarlison.</p><p>The Forest defender could have made amends at the start of the second half when he was somehow left completely unmarked but he blazed the effort into the Trent End. In fact, probably into the actual river itself.</p><p>Anthony Elanga thought he had equalised but after a VAR check, was ruled offside</p><p>And then home keeper Turner, under pressure from Son, suffered a couple of moments he will want to forget.</p><p>He ended up passing the ball straight to Kulusevski who had too much nous for defender Moussa Niakhate although the shot went through Turner’s arms.</p><p>Spurs were then down to 10 men after the sending off of Bissouma who was initially given a yellow card before ref Jarred Gillett was called over to a monitor following a VAR check.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>But for Postecoglou and Richarlison, in particular, the last few days have been a lot better than the previous couple of weeks.</p><p>Catch up on all the action with our live blog below…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fJRrbmpxX6O8tcDIp56hmZ1is7C%2BxKyrZq6jYsGwwNOepaGZnWK5qsLEZqqcp6KaerG%2BxKagnqpdobKis9SeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
