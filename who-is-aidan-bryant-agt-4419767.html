Over the course of the season, Aidan stepped up his game big time. He wowed the judges, the audience, and the viewers at home with each and every performance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Aidan has been one to watch this season of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AGT: All-Stars</a>. He’s only 18 years old, but he’s a force to be reckoned with. Now he’s about to enter an exciting next chapter. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up everything you need to know about Aidan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aidan-Bryant-5-Things-AGT-NBC-embed-2.jpg><h2>1. Aidan came in second place during AGT season 16.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Aidan made his America’s Got Talent debut during season 16 when he was just 16 years old. He was a frontrunner from the very beginning of the season. The season ultimately came down to Aidan and magician <strong>Dustin Tavella</strong>. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dustin won season 16</a>, and he will also be competing against Aidan in AGT: All-Stars. In the AGT: All-Stars finale, Aidan beat out <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Avery Dixon</strong></a> to become the winner.</p><h2>2. Aidan was inspired by Pink.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The 16-year-old saw a YouTube video of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pink</strong></a> performing an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>aerial routine</a> at a concert when he was 14. After that moment, Aidan’s life was never the same. “I went into my grandma’s closet, found a sheet, put two straps on it, got a ladder, and hung up it in a tree in the garden,” Aidan told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>.</p><h2>3. Aidan is a self-taught aerialist.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>After watching Pink, Aidan began learning the basics of aerial performance using a bedsheet. His mother eventually got him his first silk as a Christmas gift. “It took me a while to get used to it. I started finding different ways to get on and off it,” he told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. He also credits aerial performance for getting him over his fear of heights.</p><h2>4. Aidan has always been a fan of AGT.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I’ve watched America’s Got Talent all my life. It was my dream to be on it and perform in front of the judges,” he told the outlet. After his near-win in season 16, Aidan is setting his sights on the AGT championship once again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aidan-Bryant-5-Things-AGT-NBC-embed.jpg><h2>5. Aidan is incredibly creative.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In addition to aerial performance, his mother, <strong>Pam Bennett</strong>, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that Aidan would make rainbow loom bracelets and would sell them at farmers’ markets. He would also make infinity lights and sell them at craft shows.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KuqrDAp2SbqqmWu7V5wKCrZmxkZoZ4gpZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
