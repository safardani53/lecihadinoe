Anywhere, including McDonald’s.</p><p>Some employees, it seems, take this policy much more seriously than others.</p><p>Because soda-theft is apparently what prompted a couple of McDonald’s employees to deliver an epic beatdown to a customer. And you can see it all in the video and gifs that we’ve included.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>(Note: this still image is worth seeing on its own, but we made gifs of some highlights below)</p><p>In a video posted on Wednesday night, several unidentified persons were involved in a brawl at an undisclosed McDonald’s.</p><p>A customer runs, tossing what appears to be a milkshake and then a tray behind her, perhaps in an effort to slow or deter the tall employee who is pursuing her.</p><p>Her efforts are unsuccessful.</p><p>The taller employee appears to corner her against a table and, as they say, wail on her with her fists.</p><p>The customer’s efforts to fight back do not appear to be successful. She gets flung across the aisle and onto a table like a rag doll.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We have to show you the censored version of this brutal pummeling, folks.&nbsp;</p><p>The obscenities are one thing, but the unidentified customer gets such a thrashing that her boob pops out and flops around everywhere.</p><p>(Since we do not know her identity, we also cannot verify her age)</p><p>Her breast popped out because her top, appropriate for this unspeakably hot summer weather, is less than ideal for a knock-down, drag-out fight.</p><p>Comics artists who like to draw superheroes wearing what looks like a few ribbons should take note: it is not realistic combat attire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>TMZ reports that this <a href=#>McDonald’s fight</a> was apparently all started after the customer tried to use a water cup to steal soda from the soda dispenser.</p><p>We have to assume that there was some escalation between "ma’am you need to buy a soda" and the absolutely ghastly display of violence caught on video.</p><p>It sounds like the customer may have insulted the taller employee’s mother, though honestly, a lot of what’s said in the video is difficult if not impossible to understand.</p><p>We’re hesitant to say who started it without knowing the whole story, especially since it appears that people are committing some crimes — in addition to workplace violations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Most of us, if we were lifted into the air and slammed into a table, might try to end the fight.</p><p>A couple of others try to intervene, and another employee moves the customer away while also restraining her.</p><p>The customer, who is tiny but appears to be 100% ready to fight, struggles to escape the shorter employee’s grasp.</p><p>It appears that the shorter employee loses her patience because she responds with some hair-pulling and is shown delivering some blows of her own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Even after things appear to be settled — again — the customer grabs what looks to be an aluminum chair and begins to charge towards the taller employee.</p><p>Folks, please do not get into fights. And if you just escaped a fight in which you were decidedly on the losing side, do not try to start things up again.</p><p>McDonald’s is not a buffet — do not go back for seconds.</p><p>Thankfully, the taller employee is able to diffuse this situation — sort of — by confiscating the chair.</p><p>(She just takes it from her)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Again, there is so much that we do not know. There is even — as always — technically a possibility that a group of friends staged all of this to go viral.</p><p>But … we somehow doubt it. This looks very real.</p><p>Fight choreographers for television shows should take note.</p><p>We want to stress again that we do not know who the original aggressor may have been in this conflict.</p><p>We can only imagine what is going through the minds of McDonald’s corporate as they watch this video go viral.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8rq%2FDqKWapJSoeri70aScq6tdmbKttdWeqWaaoqrBoriMm5yarJSkxK9506hkpqGcoMCprcqeZK2goqTEqrrGaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
