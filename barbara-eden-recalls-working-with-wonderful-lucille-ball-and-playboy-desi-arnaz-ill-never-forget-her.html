I'm going to stand up for this one." She did, then answered, "She was wonderful! She was absolutely a wonderful, beautiful person to work with."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eden shared that her appearance in an episode of I Love Lucy in 1957 alongside Ball was her third job in Hollywood. "I'd had a little difficulty with the second one, who was a diva I worked with and she didn't like me, so I was really worried," Eden admitted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following her unfortunate experience with the other actress, she knew she had to be cautious when she found out she was working with Ball. "I thought, 'OK, I'll be very careful. I'll stay out [of her way],'" she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eden added, "And I knew Desi was a playboy, so I knew I had to be careful there."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Harry Langdon/Getty; Archive Photos/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily for Eden, Ball surpassed her expectations. "She was lovely!" the actress said, remembering her role as Lucy's "country cousin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[Lucy] was in her dressing room and she's like, 'Barbara, come here, come here.' And I'm like, 'Oh my god. It's going to start. Here it is.' She said, 'Do you like that dress?' And I said, 'I love it. It's fine, it's fine, everything's wonderful,'" Eden recalled. "She said, 'Take it off.' So I take it off. Do you know that Lucy and her assistant sat there and put those shiny things [rhinestones] on that dress? They punched them in. But it was to make the dress look better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eden added, "That was Lucy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress also shared that Ball wanted to sign her at the time but she had already signed with Fox. "I often wonder how wonderful it would've been to work with her as a coach and a teacher," Eden reflected. "But Lucy, I'll never forget her."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, Eden opened up to PEOPLE about her amazing journey throughout the years and why she doesn't plan on retiring any time soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes one is forced to slow down, but I'll do what I do until I can't," she said with a laugh.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Harry Langdon/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eden has long been one of Hollywood's most beautiful and ageless stars, but these days, Eden has largely given up glam to enjoy a low-key life in Beverly Hills with her husband of 30 years, real estate developer Jon Eicholtz, 83, and their Labradoodle puppy, Bentley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't wear any makeup, just usually a mask and dark glasses," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Tucson native, who spent most of her childhood in San Francisco, discovered her love for performing early, singing in the church choir and competing in pageants. Her big break in Hollywood came in 1955 when she became a recurring sketch performer on The Johnny Carson Show before she landed her career-making Jeannie role on the NBC sitcom in 1965, starring alongside Larry Hagman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's easy to live with," Eden says of her iconic character, Jeannie. "She really is. I like her a lot. I think what makes me so happy is that so many people around the world like her. Not me. They like that character. And they like the show for what it is. It takes people out of themselves and into another world. And I appreciate that. I like it very much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The show, which aired for 139 episodes from 1965 to 1970, followed a 2,000-year-old genie, played by Eden, and an astronaut with whom she falls in love with and marries, played by Hagman.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Silver Screen Collection/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Eden was finding great success in Hollywood, she faced a series of devastating blows after the show ended, including two divorces, the loss of an unborn child and her son Matthew's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2001 death</a> at age 35 following a heroin overdose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If anything, the challenges she's faced — both professionally and personally — have taught her valuable lessons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People have to find their own way," she said. "Don't be afraid. Everyone's life is different. Everyone's beginnings are different. Learn to recognize in other people what you have inside yourself because that's the one thing we all have. We're all connected. Knowing that kind of got me over a lot of humps when I first came to town and started auditioning."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, Eden — who published her first children's book, Barbara and the Djinn, with coauthor Dustin Warburton — is happy with where life has taken her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm really lucky," she said. "I have dear friends. I have a wonderful family, a very supportive husband, a dog who is adorable, but a brat! Yes, I'm very happy. I think life, everything, has to work itself out. There's a reason for most things, and I can't wish for it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christmas Con in California continues through Sunday.
