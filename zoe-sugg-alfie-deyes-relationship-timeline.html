Though they'd been dating since then, they didn't make their relationship public until 2013, when Zoë wrote up a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> to confirm their romance. Essentially, she addressed preexisting rumors that she and Alfie were already "Zalfie."</p><p>She also insisted that while they were going public with their relationship, they would not be an "online couple."</p><p>She wrote, "We won't be vlogging romantic meals out, or us holding hands, or doing ultra soppy or couple-y videos and Instagrams. It's something we'd just like to keep to ourselves, which we have every right to want to do."</p><p>Nevertheless, they'd officially revealed their relationship status to the world and have been together ever since.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Their relationship progressed rather smoothly from there. A year later in 2014, the two of them revealed that they had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moved in together</a>, a big step in any budding relationship. That same year, they adopted a pet pug named Nala together.</p><p>Later in 2017, they moved to a new home in Brighton, England.</p><p>After several more years of relatively uneventful romance, the two of them hit a major milestone in their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In March of 2021, Zoë that she was pregnant with her and Alfie's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first child</a>. They would give birth to little baby <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ottilie Rue Deyes</a> later that September.</p><p>What's more, they revealed Zoë's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">second pregnancy</a> two years later in July 2023. The new baby is due in December of this year.</p><p>Now after all those milestones, they're officially ready to tie the knot. On Sept. 14, 2023, Zoë revealed on Instagram that she and Alfie have officially gotten engaged. Similarly, Alfie shared Zoë's post in his own story.</p><p>There's no better way to cap off a decade of romance than with engagement rings.
