Throughout the eight Harry Potter films, Hagrid is a constant source of affection and trust for Harry as he navigates through love, sorrow, detachment, and even near experiences with death.</p><p>Robbie Coltrane, the actor who played Rubeus Hagrid in all of the Harry Potter films, deserves a lot of credit for Hagrid’s unmistakable charm in the films. The actor performed an outstanding job of developing the character on film, as well as gelling well with other characters, making his sequences some of the most unforgettable moments in movie history.&nbsp;As we mourn the untimely death of Robbie Coltrane at the age of 72, here are some of the best Hagrid sequences from the Harry Potter films.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I’ll never know anyone remotely like Robbie again. He was an incredible talent, a complete one off, and I was beyond fortunate to know him, work with him and laugh my head off with him. I send my love and deepest condolences to his family, above all his children. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/tzpln8hD9z</a></p><p>— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 14, 2022</a></p><h2>1) When Harry meets him for the first time (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone)</h2><p>The sequence in which Rubeus Hagrid is initially introduced to Harry and the audience is perhaps his most touching. It is also a significant turning point in the plot.&nbsp;On the eve of Harry’s eleventh birthday, Hagrid breaks through the door and awakens everyone in the little secluded house. He presents Harry with a freshly made cake. “I baked it myself, words and everything,” he continues, clearly pleased with himself.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rubeus-Hagrid-1.jpg alt="Rubeus Hagrid" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The sequence went on to capture the hearts of viewers and is recognized as one of the most touching moments in the whole series.&nbsp;The moment is important because it foreshadows Hagrid’s future connection with Harry. Hagrid’s presence in Harry’s life is a continual comfort that he is loved, similar to how he arrives just when Harry feels lonely on the night of his birthday.</p><h2>2) When he consoles Hermoine after Draco refers to her as a mudblood (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)</h2><p>Despite being a fiction film series, Harry Potter is profoundly reflective of life’s truths. Every figure represents a different aspect of society and the politics they are involved in.&nbsp;Hagrid, too, is a multifaceted character. As naïve and naive as he seems, he is one of the smartest and most diligent students at Hogwarts.</p><p>When Hermoine is unhappy at being dubbed a mudblood, they wind up at Hagrid’s to assist Ron with the slug issue. Draco’s actions show Harry for the first time the kind of bigotry that muggle-born people face. Hagrid tells Hermoine that she is one of the finest witches of their time and explains to Harry why Draco did it.&nbsp;The scenario concludes with Hermoine seeming content and smiling at Hagrid’s remark.</p><h2>3) When Harry informs him that there is no Hogwarts without him (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)</h2><p>The majority of Rubeus Hagrid’s contributions to Harry’s life and Hogwarts, in general, go unappreciated. Nonetheless, it’s nice to see Harry admit that his life might not have been as amazing if Hagrid hadn’t been there.</p><p>In Chamber of Secrets, Harry declares in the Great Hall that Hogwarts cannot exist without Hagrid, then rushes towards him for a comforting embrace. Following this, the kids in the hall cheer Hagrid. It solidifies Harry and Hagrid’s connection, which is merely the beginning of a lovely, profound friendship.&nbsp;The moment worked not just in the setting of the film, but also with lovers of the novels because of the value it places on the character.</p><h2>4) The Funeral of Aragog (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince)</h2><p>Half-Blood Prince is one of the series’ most visually fascinating flicks. Despite the gloom that has taken over the planet at the time, it has a balanced tone. At Aragog’s burial, Harry indulges in his bond with Rubeus Hagrid by letting go of his anxiety about saving the world in a particularly memorable moment.</p><p>That day, Harry is very thrilled because he receives the Felix Felicis, which is meant to bring him good luck. He chooses to go see Hagrid right away and discovers that he is grieving Aragog’s death.&nbsp;It’s a lovely sight when Harry walks up to a sobbing Hagrid. Although we don’t particularly sympathize with Aragog, the scenario draws our attention as Rubeus Hagrid’s childish feelings are revealed.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rubeus-Hagrid-2.jpg alt="Rubeus Hagrid" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>5) Before the climax when he carries Harry (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II)</h2><p>One of the most depressing moments of all time is Hagrid carrying Harry, who is presumed to be dead at the time. While Hermoine expressly sobs, Ron is stunned, and Neville speaks frankly about Harry, Rubeus Hagrid, who originally informed Harry that he is a wizard and remained his friend throughout, wears a blank look.</p><p></p><p>Hagrid’s expression says a lot about what he’s going through. While it may seem that Hagrid’s sentiments at the moment were not addressed, it is Coltrane’s acting that speaks through the quiet.&nbsp;JK Rowling was among the numerous fans, friends, and co-stars who tweeted in honor of Robbie Coltrane. Coltrane’s death has been mourned by the whole Harry Potter fandom.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhsZq2em7yzs8Stq5qanJp6s8HBnqysZZiWtLO1w2aqnJ2emsBuu81mn5qqoq56sbvTrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
