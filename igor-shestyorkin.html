His father, Oleg Shestyorkin, was a soccer player, and his grandfather was a volleyball fanatic. Reasoning the same, his parents had not intended for their son to play hockey from the start.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the young Russian never imagined himself in a hockey arena; but who knows what destiny has planned. The start of Shestyorkin’s career trip happened by chance.</p><p>It all started when the little guy went to see a game at the hockey palace near their home in Setun with his mother and a friend.</p><p>Igor couldn’t suppress his excitement as he watched each athlete demonstrate their incredible skating ability during the match.</p><p>Shestyorkin went home after the game to tell his father about his experience.

Instead, he performed his father role by ensuring that Shestyorkin did not face too many difficulties in his professional life.</p><h4>Mother&nbsp;</h4><p>Every champion has a strong mother who encourages, motivates, and supports the child with her unconditional love.</p><p><strong>Elena Shestyorkina</strong> is Igor’s mother, and she has always shown him a lot of love since he was a child.</p><p>Elena is a powerful woman with a sound financial education, considering her youthful appearance.</p><h2>Early Career&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Shestyorkin began his career at Krylya Sovetov Moscow before being taken 43rd overall in the 2012 Kontinental Hockey League Draft by Spartak Moscow as a 16-year-old.</p><p>In the 2012–13 season, he played for MHK Spartak in the MHL, his first season with Spartak.&nbsp;</p><p>Igor made his professional and KHL debut midway through the following 2013–14 season.

But, of course, he has a long way to go before catching up to Robin Lehner, the Swedish goalkeeper.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/igor-shesterkin-gf-819x1024.jpg><p>On the other hand, Igor has already taken the first step in dating <strong>Anna Butusova</strong>, his lovely girlfriend.</p><p>Shestyorkin’s girlfriend, Anna, has 300 thousand Instagram followers, roughly seven times that of her boyfriend (as of 2021).</p><p><span>Igor Shestyorkin: Lifestyles & Interests</span></p><p>The fact that the goaltender has acquired considerable money since his ascent to prominence is no longer news.</p><p>As things are, Igor makes sure he gets the most out of life.
