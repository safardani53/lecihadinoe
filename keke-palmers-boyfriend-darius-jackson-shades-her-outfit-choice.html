The Nope actress donned a skin-tight black bodysuit with a sheer black polka dot cover-up on top.</p><p>After receiving backlash for his harsh words, Jackson&nbsp;doubled down on his sentiments. He went on to imply that his girlfriend looked inappropriate and should not show off her assets now that she is a mother.</p><p>“We live in a generation where a man of the family doesn’t want the wife & mother to his kids to showcase booty cheeks to please others & he gets told how much of a hater he is,” he penned via <a href=#>Twitter</a>. “This is my family & my representation. I have standards & morals to what I believe. I rest my case.”</p><p>Palmer, for her part, has not reacted to her partner’s <a href=#>critical comments</a> on her clothing choices.</p><p>Palmer and Jackson — who have been dating since August 2021 — <a href=#>welcomed their first child</a>, son Leodis, in February. (The actress originally announced her pregnancy while hosting <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> in December 2022.)</p><p>“Born during Black History Month, with a name to match 😄!” she wrote alongside the announcement of her newborn’s arrival. “LEODIS ANDRELLTON JACKSON, welcome to the world baby Leo.”</p><p>After welcoming their baby boy, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Palmer was “blissfully happy” as she took on her new role as a mom.</p><p>“Leo’s got a lively personality, and he keeps Keke and Darius on their toes,” the insider noted at the time. “The sleepless nights have been a struggle … Darius has been a huge help, and Leo is just a joy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>However, motherhood wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows for the <a href=#>Nickelodeon</a> alum. In June, Palmer faced her first <a href=#>struggle as a mother</a> when she claimed that TSA threatened to <a href=#>throw out her breast milk</a> supply while she was traveling through the Houston airport.</p><p>“Breast milk discrimination at the Houston airport ruined my mood. I should’ve popped my tit out right then because the discretion and comfort of pumping is thwarted with threats to throw out over 16oz my babies food?!?!!! Why is that not a crime??” she tweeted at the time. “I’M A MOTHER for crying out loud 😩😢.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZuaerGty6acq6tdl7y6stGinKecXZmus7XUrGSjmZOgwLC6jKyfmpyVqHqpsdFmpq6slp7Bbq%2FHqKCcnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
