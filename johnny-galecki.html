Johnny’s father was stationed on an Air Force Base in Belgium when he was born. He grew up in Oak Park, Illinois, and had an early talent for making up stories. This creative streak led to his career as an actor. He made his debut in 1987 on the CBS miniseries, Murder Ordained. Johnny famously played Rusty Griswold in National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation in 1989 and the role of David Healy on the U.S. sitcom, Roseanne, from 1992 to 1997. During the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Johnny appeared in movies I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Opposite of Sex and Vanilla Sky. Though Johnny appeared on a handful of television series, he wouldn’t make his triumphant return until 2007, when he was cast as Dr. Leonard Hofstadter in the CBS hit sitcom, The Big Bang Theory. His performance in the role would earn him Emmy, Golden Globes and Screen Actor Guild nominations.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Johnny Galecki is best known as a sitcom actor, playing David on Roseanne and Leonard Hofstadter on The Big Bang Theory.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>While working on The Big Bang Theory, Johnny struck up a relationship with his costar, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Kaley Cuoco</a></strong>.
