You will see in her before photographs that her nose on front profile is wider and now it is much slimmer.</p><p>"She would have made these <span id=67f3573b-7c1e-4e99-b95f-9b7745277d27 class=suggested-link>corrections</span> to her nose to make it harmonize more with her other <span id=42468593-26fb-42fa-b128-61dcc960565f class=suggested-link>features</span>. She’s addressed the width of her nose and defined the tip.”</p><h2>MEGHAN MARKLE&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707628271.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/846f4f2b-8b8b-4ce8-8e8b-95010235a35e.jpg><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> is known for her acting, her status as a former Royal, and her natural beauty.</p><p>After looking back at her high school photos compared with her photos today, however, some people believe her perky nose is the result of a little surgery.</p><p>Her nose gets googled 4,000 times worldwide per month.</p><p>Dr. Karidis, however, is not so sure that’s she had any work done: “In Meghan’s earlier pictures there isn’t a huge difference. Sometimes the face grows around the nose and the nose shape doesn’t change at all.</p><p>"I’m not entirely convinced she’s had rhinoplasty. Her facial characteristics change with weight, you will notice this during her pregnancies, which may be the case in this instance.”</p><h2>JENNIFER ANISTON</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707628374.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000706137267.jpg><p><span id=c8937715-5d86-4869-88f6-1ac9f44396ee class=suggested-link>Next</span> on our list is the beloved <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>. After rising to widespread fame in the ‘90s thanks to Friends, she has continued to garner attention from everyone.</p><p>And… so has her nose. In 2018, she admitted to having two nose <span id=9f4fe9be-f753-46f7-8c52-2ed1029ea3dc class=suggested-link>jobs</span>, which is likely why her nose gets googled so much.</p><p>Dr. Karidis commented on her rhinoplasty: “Again, she had a bump on the profile, front and side, and the mid proportion of the nose was wider before. Her result now is natural and <span id=d7fd4ea1-9bba-4d3c-8936-fed374f4d5a9 class=suggested-link>suits</span> the symmetry of her face.”</p><h2>ARIANA GRANDE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000681381310.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000681381308-1.jpg><p><a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>’s petite frame and small features are part of what makes her, her — along with being one of the most successful, best-selling artists of all time.</p><p>Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many have speculated</a> that she’s had a nose job, she denied those rumors in 2019 in a tweet that read: “Hayyy this my birth nose what tf did i log onto today lemme have a cute nose damn.”</p><p>Dr. Karidis said it’s difficult to make a definite call: “Some of these photographs have been airbrushed so it’s hard to gauge whether she has had rhinoplasty.</p><p>"You have to take into account her age when she became famous and the growth in between.</p><p>"Ariana never had a large nose but she did have a slightly rounded tip and bump on the bridge. It looks as though this could have been reduced slightly to give her a more polished and dainty appearance”.&nbsp;</p><h2>ANNABELLE WALLIS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707628696.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/7357b87c-1971-4a38-ae5c-e646f7184eec.jpg><p>Best known for her roles in British TV shows like The Tudors and <a href=#>Peaky Blinders</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Annabelle Wallis</a> too has been the target of rhinoplasty rumors.</p><p>Her nose gets googled 2,000 times a month worldwide.</p><p>Dr. Karidis called out the differences in her before and after photos: “She did have a bump on the bridge, extending high up into the eyebrows. It doesn’t look like her nose is starting as high up on her face as it did before.</p><p>"It looks as though the height of the nose, the ‘take off’, has been reduced.”</p><h2>KENDALL JENNER</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000686919959.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000686920122-1.jpg><p>Another <a href=#>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> star and family member has made it to our list.</p><p><a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>, like her sister Khloe, has been hit with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nose job rumors multiple times</a>.</p><p>Hers gets googled a whopping 3,000 times a month across the globe.</p><p>She addressed the rumors in 2017, denying any surgeries: “It's all so exhausting. As a model, why would I have my face reconstructed?
