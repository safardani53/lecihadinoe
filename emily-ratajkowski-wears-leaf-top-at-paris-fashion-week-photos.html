The ethereal piece covered Ratajkowski’s chest and featured delicate straps that tied at the back. The design was first seen on dresses and footwear during the fashion house’s spring/summer 2023 runway presentation in October 2022. (<a href=#><strong>Zendaya</strong></a> famously modeled a similar look from Loewe via Instagram in September 2022).&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For Friday’s event, Ratajkowski paired the garment with low-rise black trousers and open-toe sandal heels. The We Are Your Friends actress accessorized with a black clutch and wore her brunette in a shaggy updo that featured tousled bangs. Before heading inside the </span><span class=s2>venue</span><span class=s1>, Ratajkowski showed off her modeling skills, posing for photographers and fans at the soirée’s entrance.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Emrata-Wears-Leaf-Shirt-0001.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Two days prior, the My Body author slayed at the </span><span class=s2>Courrèges</span><span class=s1> show. She kept </span><span class=s2>her outfit </span><span class=s1>simple and timeless, rocking a dark studded jacket and high-waisted jeans that flattered her figure. Ratajkowski had her hair styled in a middle part with her face-framing strands noticeably missing.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Cruise star has been known to sport bangs on and off</span><span class=s2>.</span> <span class=s2>Last month,</span><span class=s1> her hairstylist, <strong>Jennifer Yepez</strong>, revealed the trick to <a href=#>how she’s able to make it work</a>. “Emily likes to be a different person every day,” Yepez said during an interview with Vogue. “I always keep a bang in a purse, just in case she wants it for dinner.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ratajkowski chimed in, adding: “We would go from work and I’d be like, ‘What if I wanna wear a bang?’ And she’d have it in her purse and then she’d snap it on after a martini and I’d be like, ‘Ooh, now we’re talking!’”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Bangs aren’t the only way Ratajkowski likes to switch up her crown.
