They range from absolutely unbelievable to ones that stars make up themselves, like Robert Pattinson lying about seeing a clown die while at the circus.</p><p>Then there are mundane and believable ones, like the rumor that <a href=#>Lil Nas X</a> was once in the military.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, was Lil Nas X ever in the military? Nope.</h2><p>The "Old Town Road" singer has been, for the most part, always an entertainer or prospective full-time music artist, and according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebAnswers, has never served in the military</a>. The young man was born in 1999, making him still a teenager when his hit single debuted and launched him into superstardom.&nbsp;</p><p>Many believed that the track, which blended elements of country and hip-hop, would make Lil Nas X a one-hit-wonder, but it seemingly laid the blueprint for the singer's career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Old Town Road" is a pop sensation that may have only taken an hour to record, but it also sampled a Nine Inch Nails song (which earned Trent Reznor a Grammy) and contained country elements.</p><p>One would think that this would earn it a spot on the country music charts.</p><p>However, the country powers that be certainly didn't agree, and Lil Nas X's song was removed from the list, which angered more than a few people on Twitter. Some cited racism for the song being pulled.&nbsp;</p><p>It also didn't help those who supported "Old Town Road's" removal from those charts when Billy Ray Cyrus showed up on the remix to the track and was even heavily featured in the viral music video, which, as of this writing has more than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">710 million YouTube views</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So why do people think that Lil Nas X joined the military? It has to do with a photo he shared.</h2><p>After seeing Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop's review of his "7" album EP and seeing that he received a 6.5 for his efforts, Lil Nas X tweeted a photo of him dressed in military fatigues with the caption: "Me quitting music and joining the military after u gave me a 6.5."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><br>Obviously, it was a tongue-in-cheek response to the review, but it showed a pretty mature and web-conscious way for the rapper to respond to the less-than-favorable review. Some commenters mentioned that Nas X scored almost as high as Kendrick Lamar's "Damn" from the same reviewer and that the critic had actually scored "7" higher than a recent effort by Kanye West.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Literally better than Ye</p>â€” Lonzo MIP (33-20) (@EdwardIrra) <a href=#>June 27, 2019</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Fantano is known as being an overly harsh critic, and he seems to have since deleted his tweet after seeing Lil Nas X's response to his EP. Since the release of "7," Nas X has gone on to make even more controversial moves, like the release of his limited edition <a href=#>Satan Nike sneakers</a> as a means of drumming up hype around his "Montero (Call Me By Your Name)" track.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>In the video, he makes out with various versions of himself in a slew of biblical and period-piece sets and even gives the devil a lap dance.
