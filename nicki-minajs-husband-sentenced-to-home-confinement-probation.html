The music executive <a href=#>pleaded guilty in September 2021 to one count of failure to register</a> as a sex offender.</p><p>That same month, Us Weekly confirmed that Minaj’s <a href=#>husband could face up to 10 years in prison after he failed to register</a> when he moved to California in 2019. The New York native’s charge stems from a 1995 conviction for attempted rape. Petty served four and a half years in prison following an incident that occurred in 1994 with a 16-year-old girl. After his release, Petty must register as a sex offender whenever he moves.</p><p>Petty’s legal issues continued when he pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in 2006 after shooting a man four years prior. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and served seven.</p><p>Following his release in May 2013, Petty reconnected with Minaj, 39, <a href=#>after the couple previously dated</a>. The rapper went public with Petty in 2018 and <a href=#>they tied the knot less than one year later.</a></p><p>Ahead of their nuptials, the performer <a href=#>defended Petty after her fans questioned his previous run-ins</a> with the law. “He was 15, she was 16 … in a relationship,” Minaj replied to a fan via Instagram in December 2018. “But go awf, Internet. Y’all can’t run my life. Y’all can’t even run y’all own life. Thank you boo.”</p><p>Minaj later <a href=#>praised the influence that her husband has on her</a> state of mind. “Whenever I’m down, I can have one conversation with my husband and it will get me back where I need to be mentally,” she shared on Queen Radio in February 2020. “He’s been a really great force in my life. I’ve known him since I was 17, and I feel a level of comfort with him that I hadn’t felt before to just be myself and to share who I am.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Four months later, Minaj announced that <a href=#>she was pregnant with the duo’s first child</a>. They became parents in September 2020 <a href=#>with the arrival of their son</a>. “I think motherhood has made me see more good in people, more good in the universe. It makes you more of a forgiving person,” the songwriter said on The Late Late Show With James Corden in February. “When I look at my son, I’m reminded that I am so blessed.”</p><p>She added: “I realized, for so many women, this is their dream. Their dream is to have a child and not everybody gets that blessing. So when you have a little baby, you are reminded every day like, ‘Oh my God. Thank you God for this little gift.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGanoZOgtm65yKeYo6tdncK0rsCnm2arlaPBprrCnptmrJ9itbC5xGaaqKaWnrumucSnq2aooqSvosDIqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
