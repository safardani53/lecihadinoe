The Chiefs are set to play against the <strong>Philadelphia Eagles,&nbsp;</strong>who Travis’ brother <strong>Jason Kelce&nbsp;</strong>plays for, at their Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri on Monday, November 20 — but don’t expect to see the popstar in the bleachers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Taylor was reportedly planning on going and cheering on her beau, according to&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight.&nbsp;Unfortunately, she will not be able to make it, as she’s performing a concert of her Eras Tour&nbsp;in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>postponing her show</a> on Saturday, November 18. The show at Estadio Nilton Santos was postponed due to “extreme heat” in Brazil after a fan <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>died from cardiac arrest</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>before the concert</a> on Friday.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While the “Love Story” singer may not be at the game, it was reported that her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>parents would attend the game</a> and meet Travis’ parents for the first time, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>.&nbsp;It’s unclear if Taylor missing the game will affect whether or not her parents attend.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Taylor made her return to the stage on November 9, when her tour went down to South America. Travis<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> attended one of her concerts</a> in Argentina, and the singer even gave him a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shout-out from the stage</a> during “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Karma</a>.” The pair was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;spotted kissing backstage</a> after the show. She’ll be touring on and off over the next couple of months in international places like Brazil, Japan, Sweden, Australia, Canada, France, Italy and more. Ahead of the shows, an insider told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Travis plans on attending</a> some of the “Midnight Rain” singer’s international shows when his schedule allows so they won’t be away from each other for too long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/is-taylor-swift-attending-travis-kelce-chiefs-game-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Travis and Taylor are all in. The two are very into each other and are enjoying their time together but are also planning for the future. Taylor starts her international tour in November, and Travis is planning to be there to spend time with her,” the source said. &nbsp;“Travis and Taylor are very serious about their careers, and the two bond over that and want to show support for each other whenever they can.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Travis first attended The Eras Tour in Kansas City back in July. Shortly after the show, he admitted he tried to give a friendship bracelet to Taylor with his phone number on it, but was unsuccessful. He then later revealed he invited her to one of his Chiefs games and she ended up showing up, instantly sparking serious romance rumors. Since then, the lovebirds have been seen out and about on dinner dates and at star-studded events, like a Saturday Night Live afterparty in New York City, NY.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/is-taylor-swift-attending-travis-kelce-chiefs-game-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>As their relationship has heated up, they haven’t been shy about showing off PDA during their latest outings. Taylor also posed while kissing Travis’ cheek after the Chiefs game against the Chargers on October 22, in someone’s social media photo.
