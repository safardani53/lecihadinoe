So I would like to get some things off my chest," Ken opened his viral rant, continuing as follows:</p><p>"It’s a year next month that all the negativity against my wife started. I know I am not the most eloquent writer — I see and speak in simple terms.</p><p>"This year, there has been a huge amount of nastiness that has pushed my wife to the brink. When, at a time in her life like this, she needed her friends!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>The past several months really have been challenging for Vanderpump.</p><p>Her brother, Mark, <a href=#>died from a drug overdose last spring</a> — and, while grieving personally, Lisa has since butted heads with several of her castmates, including Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Teddi Mellencamp and Erika Jayne.</p><p>Perhaps most notably, Vanderpump was at the center of PuppyGate, an actual scandal in which&nbsp;Dorit Kemsley adopted a pet from Vanderpump Dogs… alleged that it nipped at her kids… and then returned it to a shelter, instead of two Lisa’s aforementioned organization.</p><p>From there, Vanderpump was accused of leaking a story about Kemsley’s dog to the press, an act she has since denied.</p><p>She even <a href=#>took a lie detector on air to prove her innocence</a>.</p><p>Added Todd in his diatribe yesterday:</p><p>"What really irks me is the hypocrisy of this whole matter.</p><p>"The very PUBLIC issues — lawsuits, over 50 million dollars of them, loans in default, rehab, business misdoings, bankruptcies — have all been swept under the carpet.</p><p>"Lifestyles paid for with other people’s money, I call bullsh-t!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/11/lisa-vanderpump-for-pride-683x1024.jpg><p>Todd did not cite any Bravo personalities by name in his message.</p><p>However, the only time anyone’s financial matters were brought up during shooting was on the second-to-last episode of this season, where Camille Grammer accused Kemsley and her husband of owing a friend of hers $1 million.</p><p>Grammer also wondered how Kemsley could afford all of her expensive cars and clothes given her alleged knowledge that PK is bankrupt.</p><p>Again, Todd does not mention this incident in particular.</p><p>But he does touch on <a href=#>PuppyGate</a>, specifically to how Lisa and her team helped pass House Resolution 401, which calls for an end to the dog and cat meat industry.</p><p>"It disgusts me that the very fact that a resolution passed through Congress, in an attempt to save thousands of dogs worldwide, was brushed aside — years of our work was ignored as all the focus was on just one dog (that is now in a happy home, not biting, pecking or whatever you choose to call it).</p><p>"I am not asking for anything now, not even 5 grand owed to our dog charity. But I am asking for this hatred to stop! I didn’t want my wife to go to the reunion as it has been bullying.</p><p>"Yes, I used that word, bullying, because that is what this nonstop attack has been."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The $5,000 Ken mentions here is the fee Vanderpump Dogs charges people whose adopted puppies end up anywhere other than at their rescue center.</p><p>It was a fee Vanderpump and Todd initially waived when they found out Dorit’s puppy, Lucy Lucy Apple Juice, ended up at what they claim was a high-kill shelter in Orange County as part of PuppyGate.</p><p>"It sickened me to see my wife in tears and I am proud of her even doing the Angel Food when she has been so down," Ken added in regard to LVP’s weekend appearance at a Project Angel Food charity event.</p><p>He then went into the allegation Grammer made during the season and then accused Kyle Richards of saying off camera — that Vanderpump has "bad breath."</p><p>Seriously, dude went deep in this rant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"To now attack her personal hygiene disgusts me, I could put it out here that my wife’s breath is as sweet as she is, as I am the one who kisses her daily I should know," Ken wrote.</p><p>"I am so angry as it is a vile lie…like so many other things that have been said about her.</p><p>"Attacking our [kids’] businesses, Vanderpump Rosé, which we have all worked hard on is just mean spirited! It’s in some of the best restaurants in the world."</p><p>In conclusion?</p><p>"Their pettiness says everything. There are so many things WE could’ve said but haven’t…</p><p>‘So it’s not just Goodbye Kyle that I want to say…it’s goodbye to all of the vicious nastiness…there I feel much better now. Happy birthday to me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Wow.</p><p>Well… okay then, huh?</p><p><strong>Part 2 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills reunion airs Tuesday, July 23 at 9/8c. on Bravo.</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WEcLjIrJhmrpGjsaa%2Bz66kqatdncK0rsCnm2aipajBbrDErKurp6masW6ty6VkraCVYr%2Bmrctmn6ito5rEqsLErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
