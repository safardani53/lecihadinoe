Find out which cases will be included in the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Oxygen</span></figure><p><strong>Warning: This article contains spoilers for all Season 1 episodes of Oxygen's </strong><strong>Final Moments.</strong></p><p>On April 3, Oxygen debuts its latest true crime series entitled Final Moments. The show is another reality TV production from Dick Wolf (yes, that Dick Wolf of <a href=#>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</a> and <a href=#>Chicago P.D.</a> fame), and the hook is that each case is solved — or not — based on what the victims were doing in the moments leading up to their murders.</p><p>Each episode features a different investigation, with some of them dating back to 2004. But which cases will true crime fans get to see in the first season? Are they the same old stories that viewers have seen on other shows before? Or are they brand-new mysteries? Here are all the details about Final Moments before it premieres.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBCUniversal</span><p>"Final Moments" executive producer Dick Wolf</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Oxygen's new series 'Final Moments' about?</h2><p>As the title indicates, Final Moments focuses on victims right before their murders. The show promises to tell their stories "through the lens of real footage, pictures, and the social media of our victims, giving viewers direct insight into their last moments alive," according to the network press release. That can include everything from text messages and phone records to surveillance camera footage.</p><p>The show will be using at least some reenactments with actors playing the victim, suspects, and other people in the victims' lives, as a casting call for one episode was posted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Backstage</a> in February 2022.</p><p>The series is the latest collaboration between Oxygen and Dick Wolf, whose Wolf Entertainment has also produced the Oxygen series Cold Justice, Criminal Confessions, and Murder for Hire. Oxygen, of course, is the sister network to NBC, which airs Wolf's Law & Order and One Chicago franchises.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Most of what we record on our phones is mundane but sometimes the eerie and the tragic is captured, too. <a href=#>@oxygen</a>'s new series, Final Moments, premieres Sunday, April 3 at 7/6c.</p><p>Visit the link for more: <a href=#>https://t.co/lmTp07UpPK</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/f3swElytk8</a></p>— Oxygen (@oxygen) <a href=#>March 21, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What real-life cases are featured on Oxygen's 'Final Moments'?</h2><p>The Final Moments series premiere, "Where's Dad?", centers on the New York City disappearance of Charles Butler, who vanished after a night on the town with his new girlfriend in 2012. Confusing texts sent to Butler's children led police to the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend, who was impersonating Butler after killing him and driving his body off a cliff.</p><p>The second episode, "Death of an Influencer," follows the 2013 case of teenage social media sensation Alexis Murphy in Virginia, in which police tried to use her tweets to identify her killer. Surveillance footage from a local gas station also helped identify the man who abducted and murdered her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>From Executive Producer Dick Wolf, <a href=#>#FinalMoments</a> delves into heart-wrenching crimes through the lens of real footage of victim’s last moments alive.

That means Season 1 will focus on older crimes that happened on and around the East Coast.</p><p>Final Moments premieres on Sunday, April 3 at 7 p.m. EST on Oxygen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpMW6s8SnZJ%2Bhnpa5brnOppynrKNiv6aty2ajop6VYrCiv8Ss</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
