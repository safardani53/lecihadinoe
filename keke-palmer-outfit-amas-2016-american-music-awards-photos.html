She was one of the first to arrive to the red carpet, and had everyone talking with her sexy look. The actress showed a ton of skin in a see-through silver crop top and matching skirt, in which she flaunted her toned tummy and long legs.</p><p>[interaction id=”5832380967075ce64999b075″]</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>But, of course, everyone was talking about the fact that she went&nbsp;braless under that sheer, sequined top, and you could totally see her nipples peeking through the fabric. Woops! But Keke was as confident as ever, strutting her stuff down the carpet and completely owning it.&nbsp;The outfit included a chunky, silver choker, and she matched her shoes by rocking open-toed, silver heels. OH, and she wore pink sunglasses and a chic pink fur jacket on the carpet, too — NO BIG DEAL!</p><h3><a href=#>Cutest Couples At 2016 American Music Awards — PICS</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Keke completed her look with minimal jewelry and kept the hair extensions out, instead just showing off her natural, cropped short hair. Oh, and of course she had the perfect eyeshadow to go with her skirt and shirt — full-on silver! All in all, she definitely had people talking with this racy ensemble!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The 23-year-old has been&nbsp;absolutely slaying the game lately, and as she pointed out to&nbsp;E! on the red carpet, her character is one of the lucky ones to still be alive on&nbsp;Scream Queens. The cast is finishing filming up its second season and we can’t wait to see what happens next!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Keke’s AMAs red carpet look? Do you think it’s too racy…or are you totally feeling it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ye5FpZqSdm5p6sa3LppyrZZ%2Bqwae102aYppmjYn9xfZVmmKadop6worqMpqysoZNirrit0Z2qZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
