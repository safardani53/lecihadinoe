Jake, 23, had fans freaking out on Instagram when he posted an extremely flirty pic, featuring Are You The One? star <strong>Julia Rose</strong>, 26. The February 7 post shows Jake kissing Julia on the cheek as she cradles his face in her hands and puckers up. He captioned it, “bro so what.” The comments blew up, mostly with people telling them how cute they looked together. <strong>Mike Majlak</strong> from Impaulsive hinted that something’s been brewing between Jake and Julia for some times, commenting, “finally.” See the pic of Jake and Julia below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>One fan put it simply, but perfectly, with their comment: “So confused about your whole life but ok I hope your [sic] happy.” There’s apparently more than just the PDA pic that’s stirring up dating rumors. Julia, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>, was by Jake’s side all week leading up to his boxing match against <strong>AnEsonGib</strong> in Miami! At one point, they even partied with Tana. Julia posted a sizzling photo from that night on Instagram, which showed herself and Tana <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>touching tongues</a> in a club. She captioned it, “so this happened @tanamongeau”. Jake was all about it, to say the least. He commented, “imma really die.” Down, boy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Jake fans may recognize Julia as the beauty from his “These Days” music video, which premiered in December. Julia was previously engaged to <strong>Stephen McHugh</strong>, whom she met on the MTV dating show Are You The One? in 2016. Stephen popped the question in 2019, and it’s unclear when they broke up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jake and Tana had a lavish, star-studded wedding in Las Vegas in July 2019 after a very brief engagement. By January 2020, the couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced</a> in two lighthearted Instagram posts that they were putting a pause on their relationship. Tana stressed that she “made a best friend for life” when it came to Jake, and he said that he’d always love his friend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH1ze49wZqOZm5p6sa3UpWSjrZyerm6%2BzqycZqiUlnqxtcJmm5qsmaO0br7UpqarZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
