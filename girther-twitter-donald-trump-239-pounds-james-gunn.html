Trump alleged he was born in Kenya and not eligible to lead the country.</p><p>Calls for him to reveal his weight more transparently are being led by Guardians of the Galaxy Director James Gunn, whose offered to cough up £80,000 to Trump's favourite charity if he complies.</p><p>He said: "I will give 100 thousand dollars to Trump's favourite charity if he will step on an accurate scale with an impartial medical professional, okayed by both of us. For real."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000378649856-e1516186473465.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000378762338.jpg><p>Gunn, 51, shared several photos of Trump next to much slimmer men - often athletes - who are known to weight around 17 stone or less.</p><p>One example was Los Angeles-based baseball player Albert Pujol, who Gunn said was also 6'3 and 240lb (17.1 stone).</p><p>Several others followed suit, comparing the 45th president who allegedly has a penchant for McDonald's, to the likes of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.</p><p>One cheeky user even put him next to a ripped Colin Kaepernick, the former Milwaukee American Football player who Trump criticised for kneeling during the national anthem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/girther-3.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james-gunn-2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/girther-2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/girther-4.png><p>Trump's body mass index (BMI) of 29.9 put him in the overweight category - and on the brink of obese - for his alleged height at 6ft 3in.</p><p>He is known to enjoy high-fat foods like fried chicken, hamburgers and steak - and while he plays golf, he does not have a daily exercise routine.</p><p>Trump takes Crestor for his cholesterol, a low-dose aspirin for heart attack prevention, Propecia to treat male-pattern baldness and antibiotics for rosacea.</p><p>The anti-hair loss tablets have been linked to depression, a reduced sex drive and erectile problems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000378633437.jpg><p>But the US president performed "exceedingly well" on cognitive screening, which is not standard but was requested by Trump.</p><p>The doctor said he had "absolutely no concerns", adding:&nbsp;"He's very sharp. He's very articulate when he speaks to me.</p><p>"I've never known him to repeat himself when he's around me. I found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought process."</p><p>Trump's mental fitness for the job had come under intense scrutiny after the controversial best-selling book "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House," portrayed him as childlike and mercurial.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Donald Trump’s doctor releases statement outlining his physical health following medical examination</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict0003778502621.jpg><p>Past presidents are not known to have been tested for mental acuity while in office - including Ronald Reagan, who five years after leaving the White House was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Dr Jackson, who speaks with Trump a few times a day and travels with him, said he did not think the US president needed cognitive testing based on medical guidelines - but added the 30-question Montreal Cognitive Assessment at Trump's request.</p><p><a href=#>The test looks for signs of dementia or Alzheimer's</a>, an incurable, degenerative brain disease, but doesn't assess psychiatric fitness.</p><p>Sample questions include asking the patient to draw a clock face, putting in all of the numbers and setting the clock hands to a specific time.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Donald Trump flees after being questioned over controversial 's--thole country' comments</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000378627071.jpg><p>Dr Jackson said Trump scored 30 out of 30 on the test, adding: "The president is mentally very sharp, very intact."</p><p>Trump underwent the medical exam at Walter Reed National Medical Centre on Friday and Dr Jackson today&nbsp;issued a blanket declaration that Trump was in "excellent health".</p><p>Jackson said he had every confidence that the president "has a very strong and a very probable possibility of making it completely through his presidency with no medical issues".</p><p>He also has no heart disease and no family history of it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Dr Jackson said he would increase Trump's daily dose of Crestor and bring in a nutritionist to work with White House chefs.</p><p>The doctor also said he would also design a daily exercise programme for Trump,&nbsp;recommending a low-impact exercise routine like a stationary bike.</p><p>Dr Jackson said: "He's more enthusiastic about the diet part than the exercise part, but we're going to do both."</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
