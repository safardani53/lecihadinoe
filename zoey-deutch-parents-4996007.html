Zoey does indeed land in that category, as her parents happen to be big names in Tinseltown, with her father being <strong>Howard Deutch</strong> and her mother being <strong>Lea Thompson</strong>. Keep reading to find out more about her Hollywood royalty, below!</p><h2>Lea Thompson</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Zoey’s mom just happened to be the It Girl back in the 80s. Born on May 31, 1961 in Minnesota, Lea first started off as a ballet dancer before turning her sights on Hollywood. She landed a role in 1983’s Jaws 3-D and everything fell into place soon after its premiere. She followed up with roles in All the Right Moves (1983), Red Dawn (1984), and The Wild Life (1984). Then she hit it big with 1985’s Back to the Future, where she played <strong>Michael J. Fox’s</strong> love interest/mother, Lorraine Baines McFly, in the blockbuster comedy adventure. She also starred in the two sequels.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The sting of hits didn’t stop there, as Lea was the lead female in <i>SpaceCamp</i>, <i>Howard the Duck </i>and Some Kind of Wonderful. After a few more high-profile films, Lea turned to the small screen, where she had a hit sitcom on NBC in the late 90s called Caroline in the City. More recently, she has worked behind the camera, directing episodes of Resident Alien and Star Trek: Picard.&nbsp;</p><h2>Howard Deutch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Zoey-Deutch-Howard-Deutch-Lea-Thompson-parents-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Zoey’s father Howard was a frequent collaborator of the famous 80s teen comedy writer/director<strong> John Hughes</strong>. Born in New York to a music exec father, Howard soon made his way into filming music videos before landing the director’s chair for Hughes’ 1986 film Pretty in Pink starring <strong>Molly Ringwald</strong>. Two more Hughes projects — &nbsp;<i>Some Kind of Wonderful</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Great Outdoors —</i> followed for Howard. His more recent projects include directing episodic television.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>As for how the two Hollywood heavyweights came together, it was a tale as old as time in Tinseltown. Howard was directing Some Kind of Wonderful where he met and fell in love with his star, Lea. They welcomed daughter <strong>Madelyn</strong> in 1991 and Zoey followed in 1994.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9monLJllJrCta%2FHZqeaqpWjwbR5k3Jwb2hgbHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
