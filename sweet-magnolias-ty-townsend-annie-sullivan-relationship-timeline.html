As Maddie’s son and Dana Sue’s daughter, Ty and Annie developed a close relationship of their own over their years, but things got complicated between them during season 1, which premiered in May 2020.</p><p>Following the debut season, Rowland was just as intrigued as fans were by the possibility of a romance between his and Judge’s characters.</p><p>“I would love to see what happens with Ty and Annie. They are essentially ‘meant to be,’ and the first season was a chaotic one for those two and their relationship,” the actor told <a href=#>PureWow</a> in June 2020. “I cannot wait to see all of the drama that can ensue with <a href=#>Ty and Annie in season 2</a>.”</p><p>However, Annie had her eye on someone else during <a href=#>season 2</a>, striking up a new relationship with Ty’s rival, Jackson Lewis (<strong>Sam Ashby</strong>).</p><p>“Wherever the writers room would like to take this story, I’m all in,” the actress told <a href=#>HollywoodLife</a> in February 2022 shortly before the second season dropped. “I think a lot of things change this season, and there’s a lot that we’re going to see happen that is going to be unexpected to viewers and was to the cast ourselves.”</p><p>Judge added: “Annie does … find some love this season and I think that that affects everybody. No matter what is going on in somebody’s life, it always somehow ends up impacting everybody in Serenity. Everybody’s got an opinion.”</p><p>The Where’s Rose actress doubled down later that month on her refusal to pick a side in the love triangle. “Controversial, but I actually do love Annie and Jackson … dare I say just as much as I love Ty and Annie,” she <a href=#>tweeted</a>. “I mean it could also be because I know the people behind the characters. I adore them both and working with them is so fun. The opportunity to explore either storyline [sic] excites me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Rowland, for his part, was firmly Team Ty, commenting on one of Judge’s <a href=#>Instagram posts</a> in February 2022, “Ty and Annie endgame.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to revisit Ty and Annie’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BoxKax02akmp%2BepLmqrdJmq7JlpKTEr7%2FEp5tmmZ6jtqZ50q6jpaGmlrtuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquipZWhtq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
