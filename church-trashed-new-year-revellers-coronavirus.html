People were picked up in coaches from around Essex and no one was given the location.</p><p>"They had bouncers checking the vehicles and searching people for weapons before they came in. There were multiple ticket sellers but it wasn't advertised online - it was all word of mouth."</p><h2>FLOUTING THE RULES</h2><p>Three men aged 27, 22 and 35 were nicked for drugs and Covid offences.</p><p>Members of the conservation group for the church said they were "devastated" by the damage.</p><p>Astrid Gillespie, a volunteer for the Friends of All Saints, said she was "just trying to get her head round the news", having found out via a Facebook post on New Year's Day.</p><p>She said: "I went up there and the police were still there packing up the equipment that they seized.</p><p>"There were hundreds of people there, it sounded like it was a ticketed event. It was a professional set-up, they'd hired Portaloos - they're still there."</p><p>Around 100 men and women danced and drank at a bash in Sewardstonebury, just a few miles from Epping Forest in Essex - which has the highest infection rate in the country with 1,321.3 cases per 100,000 people.</p><p>They had sparklers hanging from bottles of Belvedere vodka and the £4 million property was kitted out with balloons.</p><p>The woman who organised it was fined the maximum £10,000 and 25 fixed penalty notices totalling more than £8,000 were handed out.</p><p>A generator was seized from a rave at an abandoned warehouse in Brentwood, with 100 cleared from the venue. Two people were arrested for failing to provide details and drink-driving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/essex-2-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000628354167-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000628390766.jpg><p>Tony Stone, of the College of Paramedics, said: "It really is disheartening for us to see people attend these large parties while we try to protect the public.</p><p>"The health service is really struggling with the sheer demand, and there's a huge risk of transmission from the parties. These people could be asymptomatic.</p><p>"It's highly irresponsible and disappointing for those in Covid hotspots flouting restrictions which are there to protect all of us. The Government has made clear messages that they shouldn't happen."</p><p>Father Paul Hamilton, 51, in charge of All Saints Church, which still welcomes visitors, said hippy crack canisters had been scattered over graves in the churchyard and the building stunk of weed.</p><p>He said: "I'm just saddened by the disrespect. Nitrous oxide canisters have been left on graves and the church stinks of drugs.</p><p>"The keys are left at a local pub and visitors take them to enter the church. We think they were taken, the keys were copied and then handed back."</p><p>Essex Police's Assistant Chief Constable Andy Prophet thanked those who stayed indoors but blasted: “Unfortunately, there were others who decided to blatantly flout the coronavirus rules and regulations and, ultimately, they decided that partying was more important than protecting other people.</p><p>“We’ve seized their equipment, arrested five people, and issued a large number of fines to those who think this behaviour is acceptable.</p><p>“We need you to keep yourselves, other people, and the NHS, safe."</p><h2>PARTIES STOPPED</h2><p>The party was <a href=#>just one of dozens broken up by cops up and down the country as they enforced Covid restrictions</a> as the deadly bug continues to rip across the country.</p><p>Elsewhere, singer Conor Maynard, 28, was seen on Snapchat drinking beer as he celebrated the New Year surrounded by pals on a balcony in London.</p><p>The Met Police was called to 58 illegal events. Officers issued 217 fines and five people were reported for consideration for £10,000 hits.</p><p>Two teenage boys were stabbed and a girl aged 17 was bottled after a party was shut down in Connaught Street, central London.</p><p>Commander Paul Brogden said: “We are still dealing with the stark reality of fighting a deadly virus. I urge Londoners to continue to keep themselves and their families safe by staying at home.”</p><p>Nottingham University students packed into a house party and recorded themselves counting down the last ten seconds of 2020 to post on social media.</p><p>Police swooped on ravers jamming in sub-zero temperatures in the village of Ludham, Norfolk, to seize youngsters' sound equipment ahead of the countdown.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>And Greater Manchester Police issued 105 Covid fines - with one pub in Stockport fined £1,000 for opening its doors to pull pints despite the region being in Tier 4.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The force's Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes said: "I'm sure the right-thinking majority of our residents will join me in condemning this irresponsible behaviour, which puts lives at risk.</p><p>"I would urge people to remain strong during what will hopefully be the final few months of restrictions."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000628354180-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/NINTCHDBPICT000628354178-1.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Cops break up New Year's Eve gatherings up and down the country</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>DESPITE the coronavirus regulations, some people still decided to gather at parties for New Year's Eve.</p><p>Cops were out in force across the country.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>London</strong>, 217 people were issued fixed penalty fines, while five people have been reported for consideration for a possible £10,000 fine for organising large gatherings of people</p><p>Four people were arrested for breaching Covid regulations after gathering in central London.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>Manchester</strong>, more than 100 Fixed Penalty Notices were issued for Covid breaches.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>Essex</strong>, more than £18,000 in organiser fines and fixed penalty notices were handed out overnight.</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>Northamptonshire</strong>, cops were called to more than 100 reports of Covid breaches.
