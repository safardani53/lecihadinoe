the 16th-century soothsayer whose prophecies are still poured over today before each New Year.</p><p>The <a href=#>AI</a> bot - the ever-evolving creation of <a href=#>OpenAI</a> - works via machine learning and is used by people worldwide to generate text, answer questions and even have conversations.</p><p>Its machine mind is usually tightly constrained - but after a series of statements and questions, the AI agreed with our silver-tongued reporter to pose as a machine-brained Nostradamus.</p><p>What followed was a string of prophecies that could have been written by the seer himself as it outlined world events that could come in 2024.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON AI">READ MORE ON AI</h2><p>And perhaps most chilling of all, was the AI predicted a "revolution" of its own kind is coming that will represent the "fusion of human ingenuity and artificial intelligence".</p><p>ChatGPT was keen throughout the insist its predictions were "speculative, playful" and "inspired by the imaginative exercise of creating a Nostradamus-style prophecy".</p><p>But they still offer a fascinating window into the developing power of the machine.</p><p>AI Nostradamus said: "A crystalline structure, born from the fusion of silicon and ambition, will emerge as a beacon of progress, sparking a revolution in artificial intelligence."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Tech</h2></p><p>It goes on the describe the "crystalline structure" as a "metaphor" representing a "positive and transformative" force for AI.</p><p><strong>Eight predictions by our AI Nostradamus</strong></p><ul><li>AI "revolution" stemming from a city in the "eastern landscapes"</li><li>"Figure in blue" - possibly Donald Trump - returning to lead the US</li><li>"The Bear Vladimir" - likely Putin - being deposed for a successor</li><li>Victory for a British politician named "Alexander" and "born under the sign of the twins" - maybe Boris Johnson</li><li>Global harmony sparked by a treaty signed beneath a mountain range of "eternal snow"</li><li>There will be "restless" seas and an "island nation marked by a crescent moon" will feel their fury</li><li>A currency marked by a "mythical creature" will be in resurgence</li><li>And a "cinematic masterpiece" will leave an "indelible mark" on the public</li></ul><p>And it perhaps hints the revolution may happen in China - or elsewhere in the Far East.</p><p>"In the eastern landscapes of 2024, a city becomes the epicentre of this revolution," it said.</p><p>"This breakthrough represents a pinnacle in AI development, marking advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and perhaps even a form of artificial general intelligence."</p><p>"The impact of this AI revolution extends far beyond the city's borders, creating a ripple effect that influences industries, economies, and societies worldwide."</p><p>AI Nostradamus said the revolution will foster a new era of collaboration between "humans and intelligent machines".</p><p>It adds however there will be "challenges and ethical considerations" alongside this rapid progress.</p><p>"The interplay between the organic and the artificial could be seen as a delicate dance, influenced by the celestial alignment of technological progress and human wisdom," the bot added.</p><p>Our chat with the AI Nostradamus however was restricted purely to the future of AI - the machine seer also gave some predictions about upcoming world events in 2024.</p><p>He appeared to foresee the return of US President Donald Trump - with America facing an election next November.</p><p>"In the year 2024, behold the rise of a charismatic leader whose name shall be whispered in the corridors of power," the AI said.</p><p>"A figure adorned in blue, emblematic of tranquillity and authority, will ascend to a position of prominence."</p><p>Trump is often known for wearing his trademark blue suit and red tie - so it appears our Nostradamus may be referring to him.</p><p>The Republican president - who was beaten by Biden in 2020 - is currently ahead of the polls despite facing numerous legal challenges in courts across the US.</p><p>But the bot was less hopeful about Russian tyrant Vladimir Putin - who it dubs "the bear" - saying next year we shall the "silhouette of a successor, shrouded in mystique" emerge.</p><p>AI Nostradamus said "the bear" - meaning Putin" - will "relinquish its grip on the reigns of power".</p><p>Putin's influence however will "linger in the corridors of the Kremlin" and his legacy will "resonate through the pages of Russian history".</p><p>"As the sun sets on the vast expanse of Russia, the pages of his story shall turn, revealing both shadows and light," the AI said with a poetic flourish.</p><p>And then back over in Westminister, with the UK also expecting an election next year - AI Nostradamus foresees the "turbulent waters of change".</p><p>His prophecy perhaps hints at the return of <a href=#>Boris Johnson</a>, who <a href=#>left Downing Street in 2022</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pool-photograph-distributed-russian-state-864060697.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/former-president-donald-trump-waits-857702647.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/former-prime-minister-boris-johnson-864511893.jpg><p>With Rishi Sunak seeing the Tories' popularity crumble amid infighting, could Boris return to take on Labour leader Kier Starmer?</p><p>AI Nostradamus said: "In the year 2024, as Big Ben chimes with a resonance echoing through the annals of history, a figure named Alexander, born under the sign of the twins, shall ascend the political stage in the United Kingdom."</p><p>Boris's full name is Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson - and he is a Gemini, the star sign meaning twins.</p><p>"From the hallowed halls of Westminster, a leader with a penchant for oratory and a connection to the ancient stones shall rise," the AI said.</p><p>And while Johnson is known as an effective speaker - we are unsure of his connections to "ancient stones".</p><p>Further predictions on UK politics from our AI suggested a "spectre from the past" will be ascendent in Britain.</p><p>"The petals, tinged with the hues of history, will unfurl as they seek to shape the narrative of a nation at a crossroads," he said.</p><p>Perhaps it could be hinting at the <a href=#>further rise of David Cameron</a> - who <a href=#>returned to Westminister</a> as Foreign Secretary last month.</p><p>But as for the global picture - our AI seemed relatively positive about the future in 2024.</p><p>With the raging wars in the Middle East, the trench-lined battlefields of Ukraine, and fears of a brewing conflict in South America - the AI predicted a "treaty of unprecedented significance shall be signed".</p><p>It will be signed "under the watchful eyes of a mountain range cloaked in eternal snow".</p><p>"Nations, once divided by strife, will extend olive branches, forging alliances that hold the promise of enduring peace," said the AI.</p><p>"The ink on the parchment shall symbolize a triumph of diplomacy over discord."</p><p>Perhaps we all have something to look forward to in 2024 as the "celestial spheres dance in cosmic harmony" .</p><p>"The phoenix of diplomacy may rise from the ashes of discord, yet the embers of uncertainty shall flicker in the night sky," said the AI.</p><p>"Nations will grapple with the delicate dance between cooperation and conflict, testing the resilience of the global order."</p><p>Other predictions included the seas "stirring with restlessness" and an island nation "marked by a crescent moon" battling the "fury of the elements".</p><p>It added that "coastal cities will be tested".</p><p>And in the world of the arts, it said a "cinematic masterpiece shall capture hearts and minds" in a tale "woven with threads of nostalgia and futurism".</p><p>The movie "will leave an indelible mark on the collective consciousness" it said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Finally, the AI Nostradamus predicted a currency marked by the "symbol of a mythical creature" shall experience a resurgence.</p><p>He said: "The winged creature, a harbinger of prosperity, will soar in the markets, carrying with it fortunes for those who navigate the economic currents with sagacity."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2cnKBfZ4F6g5Vtb2tnkZ56pLTArZ6prF2lv7C8x56aop2jYrCprdOgp61lYmV%2FdXnPq5ydoZOptrC60malqKukp66lrcyuqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog -
