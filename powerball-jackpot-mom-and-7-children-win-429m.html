When the winning numbers were called on May 7, theirs was the only ticket sold across the country that matched the five winning numbers plus the Powerball.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Our mother bought the ticket for us we pooled all our money together and left it in her hands,” Valerie Arthur, one of Pearl’s daughters, said at a press conference Friday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Arthur, who retired last year after working as a prison administrator for 27 years, said she couldn’t believe it when her sister called to tell her the family had won.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I said, ‘Stop April fooling me!’ And she said, ‘It’s May!’ She said it’s true we won the Powerball and I haven t slept since then.” Arthur recalled with a laugh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pearlier picked out the winning numbers: 5-25-26-44-66 and the Powerball number, 9. She said the numbers came to her via “divine intervention.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We had a divine intervention give us the numbers, that’s the only way you could explain it,” Arthur said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because the ticket was purchased as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>cash payout</a>, the family will take their winnings in a lump sum of $248 million, or about $204,480,000 after taxes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Usually when you go and play the lottery and they ask you cash or annuity,” Arthur explained. “Your age factor comes in and you think, ‘Am I going to wait around 20 years for the cash?’ If I was 20 maybe but I’m well past 20.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Smith family said they planned to split the lump sum evenly and that their biggest priorities were paying off student loans and mortgages. The six siblings who are still working said they went to work the day after they learned they had won, adding that they had no immediate plans to quit their jobs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked about lavish trips or major purchases, the family said that after buying cars for their kids and grandkids, they wanted to use the money to help their communities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This was an affirmation from God because we each have dreams we want to fulfill in this life for what we want to do for our communities,” Arthur said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pearlie’s daughter Catherine plans to use some of her winnings to help fund a mentoring program for young women she has run for the past 15 years. “She has been struggling for funding and now she can do that with her own funding,” Arthur said. “She can go and change lives on her own accord.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family took a few days to come forward as they were assembling a team of financial advisers. They said their friends and employers don’t even know the news yet – but they expect to hear from them soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I suppose in about an hour for now everyone we know will come out of the woodwork,” Arthur said. “There’s a lot of people and a lot of different organizations that we really want to help.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We get to pick! Don’t come to us!” she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone looking to glean the family’s lottery-winning strategy, Arthur explained that they are infrequent lottery ticket buyers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We usually play when the Powerball gets over a certain amount,” Arthur said. “We’re not avid players – we play just like everybody else when the lottery goes up.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family’s prize was the sixth biggest jackpot in Powerball history and the biggest amount won by a single ticket sold in New Jersey. “I just want you to know that anything can happen in New Jersey!” Arthur concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmegpMSmvsGao6VlmpawrLzOrWSmp51irq%2BwjHBknKCZobGzsc1mrqKmXWl%2FermO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
