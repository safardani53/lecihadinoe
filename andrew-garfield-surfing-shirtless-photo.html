The&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>British actor</a> rode the waves completely solo and then removed his black wetsuit to show off his shirtless body. Andrew walked through the sand near the edge of the water while holding his blue and yellow striped <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>surfboard</a>. His big muscles were on display as he lifted his surfboard seemingly with complete ease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Andrew-Garfield-Shirtless-Surfing-BG-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Andrew wore a full black wetsuit for his fun-filled day spent surfing in the sun. He took off the top of his wetsuit to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>catch some sun rays</a> on his chest, shoulders and arms, but he kept the rest of his body (sans his feet) covered in the outfit. Andrew also rocked some <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>facial hair</a>, including a lengthy beard, a mustache, and long sideburns.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Andrew’s surfing session comes amidst his <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>brief break from acting</a>, which he announced in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>&nbsp;from late April. “I’m going to rest for a little bit,” the star explained. The past year has been so busy for Andrew with his high-profile projects like his&nbsp;limited series Under the Banner of Heaven&nbsp;and his films <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Eyes of Tammy Faye </a>and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tick, Tick … Boom!</a>, which earned him his second Oscar nomination in his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Andrew-Garfield-Shirtless-Surfing-BG-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I need to recalibrate and reconsider what I want to do next and who I want to be and just be a bit of a person for awhile,” Andrew further said in the interview. The actor is also recently single following his split from his girlfriend, model&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alyssa Miller</strong></a>. However, the pair proved they’re <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>still on good terms</a> when Alyssa <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared a selfie</a> of the&nbsp;two&nbsp;making silly faces. A source also confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;that Andrew and Alyssa broke up in March, but “remain friendly” following their split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5JpZpqmlKeyuHnGmqmfoZWhsW6%2F1KudoqaXYsCptdGto56ro2K9qbvTqGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
