Then, at the end of the dump, there was a picture of Kylie and Travis hugging each other, which was also surprising for fans as they usually keep their relationship rather private.</p><p>In the latest season of The Kardashians, Kylie revealed that she and Travis had never thought of a name. She further explained that she initially called the baby Wolf, and it was Khloé Kardashian’s idea to call him that to ensure he had a name on the birth certificate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/11/GettyImages-1170620841-893x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kylie-slams-claim-she-posted-wolf-s-photo-to-downplay-balenciaga-scandal>Kylie slams claim she posted Wolf’s photo to downplay Balenciaga scandal</h2><p>Jenner found herself in the midst of speculation that she only shared photos of Wolf to distract from controversy concerning Balenciaga, whom her sister Kim has close ties with.</p><p>Following Jenner’s Instagram, a <a href=# rel=nofollow>TikTok</a> under the handle Psych Advice posted a video featuring the snaps of Kylie and her children with the caption: “Kris Jenner&nbsp;telling her kids to release the good photos after the Balenciaga scandal.”</p><p>Kylie&nbsp;has since hit back at the TikTok accusations that she posted snaps of her children to distract&nbsp;from the fashion brand’s recent ad backlash. As she responded:&nbsp;“Uh whyyyyyy would I post my child to cover up for Balenciaga? This is why I don’t do this, always something to say.”</p><p>The TikTok creator even wrote back to Kylie’s comment, penning:&nbsp;“I definitely understand that would be frustrating. Most of us just want more raw honesty from your family tho instead of silence like with Astroworld.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kim-kardashian-addresses-balenciaga-controversy>Kim Kardashian addresses Balenciaga controversy</h2><p>Kim Kardashian finally addressed Balenciaga’s recent controversy after initially staying silent over the controversy. She said in a <a href=#>statement </a>released on social media that, as a mother of four, she was “shaken” by the deeply “disturbing images”.</p><p>Balenciaga has taken full responsibility for making the “wrong choice” of using child models with “BDSM-inspired outfits,” and a “failure in assessing and validating images.”</p><p>Kim has been a long-time collaborator with the Spanish couture fashion house and has even modeled in the Fall 2022 ad campaign. Her future with Balenciaga is currently up in the air as she is “re-evaluating” their relationship. Since the statement, many fans have slammed the reality star for not completely cutting ties.</p><p>WATCH THE KARDASHIANS ON HULU AND DISNEY+ NOW</p><p><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel=nofollow>TIKTOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46ksKWhlWK3prrNnqlmq5yWurR5wqWYoqVdqLWmec%2Boqq2dlGLEsLjFrGSpoJ%2BpvG7AzmabqK%2BepbmixYybmKWdnpi2orPAZqqcmZ6Zrq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
