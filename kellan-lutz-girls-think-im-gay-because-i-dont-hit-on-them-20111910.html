I've heard it all," the handsome, famously buff star says.</p><p>"See, I don't really go after girls. Most of the girlfriends I've had have come after me. So it's really funny when girls get offended because I don't hit on them," explains Lutz, who has dated 90210's <strong>AnnaLynne McCord</strong> and Step It Up 3D actress <strong>Sharni Vinson.</strong></p><p>"[Girls] will transform their insecurity into, 'Oh, that makes sense, because I heard you're into guys and have a boyfriend.'" he adds of women who assume he's gay. "I'm like, 'Seriously? That's your tactic to get me to like you?' There will always be rumors, but I know who I am."</p><p>Regardless, the hunk is as gay-friendly as can be — and counts his gay male fans among his faves.</p><p>"Oh, they're the best. I love them," he gushes. "When I meet gay fans out and about, they're so great to talk to — and I'm big on hugging, because I'm from the Midwest. They're just so energetic and loving. I'm proud to have those fans, and their support means a lot to me. I don't want just girls coming to my movies; I want guys to come too!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lutz also counts several gay men among his best pals — and he says, "Honestly, I'd prefer to live with gay guys."</p><p>How come? "They're the cleanest, and they just take care of stuff. Because I'm always away, coming home to a clean house means a lot to me. Trust me, I've lived with a lot of roommates, and straight guys are just kids who don't pick up after themselves."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepJyWu2641K2xZp%2BZp7m0edOhoKejXZ66brPAsmSbnZOWwrSxjKJknaeeqXqptdNmpqdlpJ2yrnmRaWhqaWlmfXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
