apply to one of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">state quarters</a>, which were minted from 1999 to 2008, which was printed with an error and was never intended for wide release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

their own unique design, which all featured a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">George Washington</a>&nbsp;image on the obverse.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these was the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New Jersey</a>&nbsp;variety, which could be quite valuable, according to Blake Alma.</p><p>The coin collector, who runs the TikTok channel coinhub, has nearly 850,000 followers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>He often shares his knowledge on what makes particular coins rare.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON COINS">READ MORE ON COINS</h2><p>Here’s what he had to say about the New Jersey quarter with an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">error</a>.</p><h2><strong>What to look for</strong></h2><p>First, know just like all state quarters, you’ll be able to identify the state by looking at the reverse.</p><p>Right below the state name is the founded date along with the issue date at the bottom.</p><p>For New Jersey, this is 1787 and 1999, respectively.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>The image on the back features George Washington’s army during the Revolutionary War in 1776 crossing the Delaware River in a boat.</p><p>The message below the image reads “crossroads of the revolution.”</p><p>But there is an important error to look out for that should be obvious, which will apply to the color.</p><p>“You can see that it has a goldish color,” Blake said while showing an example of the error.</p><p>But he added, “it’s not actually gold, it was struck on an experimental planchet so it wasn’t supposed to be released.”</p><p>But some of them were anyways, just like one that was certified by Professional Coin Grading Services in an MS 68 grade.</p><p>Keep in mind that number scales only run up to 70 – so it’s about as good as it gets for a coin.</p><p>In a 2016&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heritage Auction</a>, it sold for a total of $3,760.</p><h2><strong>Other valuable quarters&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, there is a similar quarter out there that could be worth far more.</p><p>This will apply to the 2000 quarter with another gold look.</p><p>it was supposed to be a Sacagawea dollar coin but a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mule error</a>&nbsp;occurred, which is when a piece is struck with two dies that were never intended to go together.</p><p>If found, it could be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worth more than $100,000</a>.</p><p>There’s also a quarter with any date that could be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">worth up to $7,000</a>&nbsp;if it has enough silver.</p><p>You can tell after you weigh it and the mass comes out to six grams.</p><p>The most important date to look out for is 1932, as the D (Denver) and S (San Francisco) pieces feature the lowest mintages in the series.</p><p>These quarters are worth around $200 in average condition, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Coin Book</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 1932-D quarter is more valuable in higher grades, worth up to $13,909.</p><p>Another one is the 1936-D quarter, which is worth $24 on average.</p><p>However, it can go as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">high</a>&nbsp;as $1,227 if in an MS 65 grade, according to USA Coin Book.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, a coin collector&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;a quarter from the state series that could be worth up to $6,000.</p><p>To see if your spare change is worth anything, you can check eBay by searching the full name, selecting the "sold" listing and then toggling the search to "highest value."&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read
