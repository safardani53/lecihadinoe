href=#>Holly Willoughby</a> on <a href=#>This ­Morning</a> after hosting the show for three days last week, with fans loving her happy, relaxed style.</p><img

ever since <a href=#>Holly quit just months</a> after <a href=#>Phillip Schofield</a> was axed for having an affair with a much ­younger assistant.</p><p>Delighted viewers said having Cat back on the box was “comforting”, and insisted that she and co-host <a href=#>Rylan Clark</a> had “breathed new life” into the ­crisis-hit show.</p><p>One gushed: “I’ve gone back 20 year seeing Cat on my screen.&nbsp;It was the best for a long time!”</p><p>Sources at <a href=#>ITV</a> claimed producers had been keen to get Cat on the sofa “for a while” after Holly quit last month amid an alleged <a href=#>kidnap plot.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN TV">READ MORE IN TV</h2><p>One said: “She takes live TV in her stride and is really witty and personable with guests.</p><p>“She’s comfortable interviewing both pop stars and politicians.</p><p>“Cat would be a safe captain to steady the ship.”</p><p>It has even been rumoured ITV might try out her comedian husband <a href=#>Patrick Kielty</a>, 52, in the hope they could become the new Richard and Judy, who hosted <a href=#>This Morning</a> from its launch in 1988 until 2001.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>An insider said: “Cat and Pat has a great ring to it.</p><p>“A married couple hosting This Morning again would be the dream...although to just have Cat would be perfect too.”</p><p>But it could all have been very different for Cat, who in 2006 packed her bags for <a href=#>Hollywood </a>to host <a href=#>So You Think You Can Dance</a>, with no idea what the <span id=8d4b60a7-98fe-465a-91be-3c8772ebe154 class=suggested-link>future</span> held.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">‘You have to make yourself indispensable’</h2><p>In Britain, she was a household name after making the successful jump from children’s shows to primetime TV.</p><p>Presenting everything from Fame Academy to Stars in Their Eyes, Cat dominated Saturday night TV in the Noughties — watched by as many as 13million viewers in the days before streaming took over.</p><p>As she got ready to leave it all behind her, Cat knew she would have to fight to make it in America.</p><p>But she was so determined that she split from her boyfriend of five years, Mark Whelan, insisting work was her priority.</p><p>Few could have predicted the one-time model with the Brummie accent would become one of the UK’s biggest exports to Hollywood.</p><p>For 20 years, Cat has barely been seen on UK <a href=#>television</a> amid a stellar rise across the Pond, where she was nominated for five Emmys, hosted Fox TV’s <a href=#>New Year</a> Eve extravaganzas and even voiced a cartoon ­version of herself on <a href=#>The Simpsons</a>.</p><p>Her gamble paid off and she is now worth an estimated £12million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/917aa4a4-d7ed-4635-a402-6db99a61fbbb.jpg><p>Having started her showbiz career as a 14-year-old when she entered a <a href=#>BBC</a> competition for The Clothes Show, Cat was spotted by modelling agency Storm, who signed her and shortened her name from Catherine to Cat.</p><p>Her first break in TV came aged 20 when she co-hosted the <a href=#>MTV</a> chart show Hitlist UK with close friend <a href=#>Edith Bowman</a>, after sending in a home-made audition tape.</p><p>In 1998, she landed her four-year stint on kids’ morning show SM:TV with <a href=#>Ant and Dec</a>, and also presented spin-off music programme CD:UK for seven years.</p><p>And she showed she could keep her cool on the pop show when she asked rocker Slash from Guns N’ Roses: “What is the weirdest rumour about you?”,&nbsp;and he gave an X-rated reply about a sex act.</p><p>Instead of getting flustered, she moved swiftly on.</p><p>By 2003, Cat had graduated to weekend TV, hosting Fame Academy and Stars In Their Eyes, followed by the <a href=#>Brit Awards</a> in 2004.</p><p>Then in 2006, Brit producer Nigel Lythgoe — memorably dubbed “Nasty Nigel on Pop Idol — made her the offer to go to America to take over his show, So You Think You Can Dance?, which was then in its second season.</p><p>Cat split with long-term partner, publicist Mark, to take the job — and later confessed: “Work was the most important thing to me.”</p><p>She once said of her shot at cracking America: “I was very aware the only thing that had changed with the show was me.</p><p>“So if it bombed, I would be the English scapegoat they would ship off home.</p><p>“You have to be logical about it.</p><p>“You can’t just come over here all wide-eyed.</p><p>“You have to make it your own, make yourself a bit indispensable.”</p><p>Cat came up with the idea to interview dancers before they appeared on the show in a format change later followed by producers worldwide.</p><p>She said: “I wanted them and the audience to feel I was with them every step of the way.</p><p>“I didn’t want just to appear later on and for them to think, ‘Hang on a moment.</p><p>“Who’s this strange English chick who’s pretending to be our friend?’.”</p><p>While her fame soared, Cat had little luck with love.</p><p>She dated Twilight star <a href=#>Jack Huston</a>, 40, of the Huston acting family dynasty, for two years from 2008.</p><p>It’s said they parted after it “ran its course”.</p><p>Still looking for “The One”, the unexpected happened when Cat’s old pal, comic Patrick, flew from Ireland to LA to see her for her birthday.</p><p>The pair, who had co-hosted Fame Academy a decade earlier, quickly fell in love after his surprise trip, which saw him pick up <span id=8e7780c1-4264-4877-acab-32cc66465c53 class=suggested-link>the bill</span> for her birthday dinner.</p><p>Cat said: “That is quite possibly the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me.</p><p>“He was just sitting there hanging out with 12 of my friends, making everybody laugh.</p><p>“It was romantic, noble, kind of amazing and pretty hard not to fall in love with him.”</p><p>After just nine months of <a href=#>dating</a>, Cat and Patrick married in Rome in 2012, and kids Milo, seven, and James, five, followed.</p><p>The couple returned to Britain in 2020 and Patrick has now landed his “dream job” hosting <a href=#>The Late Late Show</a> on Ireland’s <span id=cb237ba8-0eba-4c8d-a9e6-709092f03ba8 class=suggested-link>RTE</span> One.</p><p>Part of their decision to return to the UK came amid worries over America’s <a href=#>school shootings</a>.</p><p>Cat said: “There was a moment when I was with a friend looking at potential <a href=#>schools</a> for Milo and we had to ask the question nobody wants to: ‘What do you do if there is a live shooter on the premises?’.</p><p>“They tell you exactly what would happen, whether the kids would go to a safe room or hide under the desks, and you realise...the danger suddenly becomes a reality.”</p><p>Cat’s fears were compounded when the <a href=#>FBI</a>, hunting a shooter, swooped on an LA mall Patrick was visiting with Milo.</p><p>She said: “They shut down the centre.</p><p>"I got a call from Paddy saying, ‘They’re taking us out through the fire exits but nobody can get to their car. If we walk to a junction, can you come get us?’</p><p>“He wanted to keep Milo calm, so I didn’t understand the enormity of what was happening.</p><p>“As I was <a href=#>driving</a>, I began to see helicopters, <span id=9cd22f83-d25a-45e1-9a7b-dff5d37ecac7 class=suggested-link>news</span> vans, firemen and SWAT [armed <a href=#>police</a> response] squads. It still makes me go funny.”</p><p>Cat also wanted to be close to parents Howard and Janet.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She once said: “The boys have grandparents, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews who want to be part of their lives.”</p><p>Whatever the reasons, America will no doubt miss one of its brightest stars — but Hollywood’s loss is Britain’s gain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tv-personalities-cat-deeley-patrick-860738140.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/host-cat-deeley-think-dance-860738063-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpkbIV4g49qZq2gmah6rrvRp6Cnn12YrrV5w56cpZ2pYr2iwNGimqRlm56yrcDYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
