If you want a new comfy dress you will ultimately live in, need to find that perfect wedding guest dress, or are looking for workwear dresses that are office appropriate yet still feel like you (and can moonlight as going out dresses for happy hour during the week), knowing where to start in your shopping search is key.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As far as the best places to buy dresses is concerned, Naz Meknat, a celebrity stylist who works with stars like Sterling K. Brown, says that “it all depends on what kind of dress you are looking for, the occasion, your budget, and your style.” She recommends starting at a department store or multi-brand online retailer for more variety and “access to different designers, a variety of colors, sizes, and prices all in one place.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you prefer the variety of a department store or are looking for a more curated dress collection to shop from, we researched dozens of retailers, carefully considering styles, size offerings, shipping and return policies, and more to find the ones with the best dresses. As a result, we put together a list of our top picks for all of your dress-shopping needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to discover the best places to buy dresses this spring and summer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-amazon></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ih7vce-YgwJrO83TtxZ7Rq53su4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-floral-short-sleeve-a-line-flared-midi-dress--34c84a74f29441769d71d303876e7a67.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nothing says variety and affordability quite like Amazon, which is home to thousands of dresses from hundreds of brands. No matter what you’re looking for, you’ll most likely find it here, making the retail giant the very best place to buy dresses, whether you're on the hunt for designer options or budget-friendly buys.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We personally love the affordable wedding guest dresses available, like this <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">floral maxi dress</a> that comes in a whopping 28 colors, as well as plenty of casual options (including the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon Essentials T-shirt Dress</a>) for any sunny daytime occasion that can even be worn with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>flip flops</a>. In terms of designer brands, you can find a wonderful curation at <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Shop by Shopbop</a>. For example, this <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">white poplin dress by Rails</a> could easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion, which only adds to its value (plus, it's currently on sale).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to variety, many dresses on Amazon are included in the retailer’s <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Try Before You Buy</a> initiative, allowing you to order and try on at home before purchasing.

Nordstrom is home to everything from runway designers to smaller brands and everything in between, offering a collection of dress styles that work for all occasions, including casual everyday looks, formal attire, workwear dresses, and even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">bridal style</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since Nordstrom offers a variety of brand selections, it also has a more inclusive size range, with plus and petite sizes offered (depending on the designer), as well as maternity cuts. It also has one of the best return policies around, allowing customers to return most items without the constraints of a return period.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-4XL, plus petite and maternity | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free shipping, no minimum | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Generous case-by-case basis</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-target></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Target</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/xbnS3zxN6sld3Qwl7Q2jTFbQuDo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/isabel-maternity-by-ingrid--isabel-brown-twill-maternity-shortalls-0c3447cf6e7347f7bd93ce63565aeee2.jpg"><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Target's offerings are not only relatively affordable, but the quality is there too, thanks to in-house brands like A New Day, Knox Rose, and Wild Fable to trend-forward partnerships with Who What Wear. Target also drops <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Designer Collections</a> in the spring and fall, launching collaborations with both up-and-coming and seasoned labels. The latest spring collection featured designs from Fe Noel, Rhode, and Agua Bendita, while past collections include the likes of Missoni, Rodarte, Zac Posen, Jason Wu, and Lilly Pulitzer. These collections mean you can get access to your favorite designer labels — only at a Target price point. We can't imagine anything better.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, Target offers plenty of discounts and sales, especially for those signed up for Target Circle, the retailer's reward program. Look for end-of-season sales to get the biggest discounts on dresses. Aside from the designer collections, most of Target's dress offerings lean casual — however they still offer styles appropriate for outings like weekend brunch and summer wedding attire.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-4XL | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free shipping on orders $35+ and any orders paid with RedCard; same-day shipping on select items for $10 with Shipt | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Return within 90 days for full refund on most items (120 days if purchased with RedCard); free return shipping when mailed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-walmart></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Walmart</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1380 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/A5k2j5WawnKZaW58PO0BjuiFvtc=/fit-in/1500x1380/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-05-17at3.05.11PM-1ed7981f5d904ef38d7c38d399d53d11.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the ultimate budget marketplace, it doesn't get much better than Walmart's selection. Find affordable trend-forward pieces at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Dress Edit</a>, where you can filter through for dresses of different lengths, materials, and styles.

Aside from some great dress inventory, there are some other perks when shopping at Walmart. Since there are retail locations all around the country, it's easy for most to buy online and pick up in-store and it's easy to drop off any returns as well (although it's free to mail returns, too, which you can do by dropping off at a FedEx location or scheduling a package pickup). With Walmart+, you can get free next-day and two-day shipping on any order sold and shipped by Walmart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-3X | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free two-day shipping on most items $35+; free shipping with Walmart+ | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Free returns with full refund within 90 days of purchase for most items</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wedding-guest-dresses-lulus></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Wedding Guest Dresses</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lulus</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="velvet dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QLG43Dpm5SL7FOQziwHLlhH3V9U=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lulud-ff335b9665f543768f1d9cd496887a43.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Lulus</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lulus is one of those places where you can find anything you need for your closet, and that is especially true for formalwear. The brand has a vast selection of dress styles that are all categorized based on style and occasion, making it easier to sift through more formal options. We love it for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>formal dresses</a> because the designs feel less stuffy compared to more traditional silhouettes, plus there’s a ton of style variety so you can easily find something that fits your personality and preference. However, if you're on the hunt for black-tie attire like ballgowns, we recommend looking to Nordstrom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-3XL | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free shipping over $50 | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Free returns within 30 days of delivery date</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-vacation-show-me-your-mumu></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Vacation</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Show Me Your Mumu</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jasmine Halter Maxi Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RKLdWowaJl069hjVXCObsYqCCcM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jasmine-halter-maxi-dress-2d84a8f4d7274d88a28f6accc54218cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Show Me Your Mumu</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding that perfect vacation dress can be a bit of a headache and have you running from store to store. For a one-stop shop, Show Me Your Mumu, which is a brand that's been seen on many stars from The Bachelor franchises, is our go-to place to buy summer vacation dresses. We personally love it because it has an excellent range of dress styles, most of which are either trendy or feel a little more modern than some classic and modest silhouettes. Although Show Me Your Mumu isn’t the most budget-friendly dress shop there is, you can get high-quality pieces that you love enough to wear several times, making any Show Me Your Mumu dress worth the investment. Another great thing about the brand is that it makes shopping for your next trip super easy with a curated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vacation Shop</a> page, so you can browse through all that’s available and pick out some swimsuits and accessories, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-3XL | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> $6.99 for standard shipping | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Free returns within 30 days of delivery date</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-size-range-old-navy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Size Range</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/y3U-6aBMGyMDjQGZFzZOwX9Dp9w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/old-navy-midi-wrap-dress-d1607f3703894532b13b5d885f9186a8.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for budget-friendly dresses that boast a ton of style, Old Navy is an excellent place to start. The brand not only specializes in more affordable price points but also offers a variety of classic styles — as well as some trendy designs — that work within many personal style preferences. On top of that, Old Navy is only of the most size-inclusive brands with an excellent size range, as well as tall, plus, and petite sizes offered in a majority of styles. In addition to its budget-friendly price points, Old Navy loves a good deal and typically offers coupons and rewards so you can find a dress you love for even less than the original price tag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-4XL (tall, plus, and petite sizes) | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> $7 (free after $50 for Core and Enthusiast Rewards Members) | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Free returns within 30 days of shipment date</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-trendy-dresses-zara></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Trendy Dresses</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zara</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zara Limited Edition Draped Knit Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/sK3WU--_EfThAyg3MlOAEaaDC2Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/zara-limited-edition-draped-knit-dress-f1bbb7706e424c7c89c40e108cf0b2f2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zara</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Zara might not be the first place you think of when you think of cocktail dresses, but the brand actually has a ton of great selections every season. Albeit on the more fashion-forward side of the spectrum, you can turn to Zara for a collection of stylish dresses that can easily be dressed up as cocktail dresses (or even a going-out dress) and then dressed down for more of a day-off type of look. We love Zara because many pieces feel runway-worthy without the designer price tag to match, making it a more affordable place to shop for dresses, too. If you live near a brick-and-mortar location, you can opt for in-store pick-up when ordering online and always get free shipping (if not, you’ll need to spend $50).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XXL | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free shipping over $50; free online pick-up for any order | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Free returns within 30 days of the shipment date</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sustainable-reformation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Sustainable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Andee Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SvtY2WAlddUH1cs2dsJ5F97aXxg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-andee-dress-071b0555e4b4465981fa75c5a516242d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Those looking to invest in multi-functional, versatile pieces that can result in a low cost-per-wear over time, you'll love Reformation.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our top pick for the best investment dresses is Reformation. While this isn't your typical runway designer, Reformation makes some of the most high-quality dresses with even higher standards. The brand plans to be climate positive by 2025 and has a variety of necessary practices in place to do so — including cleaner and more efficient practices. Apart from its sustainable lens, Reformation has some truly special designs that feel timeless and classy, even when they boast a more trendy style. From formalwear to wedding guest dresses to going-out dresses, you can find a variety of options that fit your occasion and style that can be worn again and again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS-3XL | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free shipping on everything | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Return within 30 days of delivery date</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-workwear-banana-republic></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Workwear</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5Mo5ODAx43GCB_x1L89BUKLzLNk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/banana-republic-giulia-midi-dress-95b95a56ee5a4b368c5fcef392df86d8.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for the best dresses for the office to wear with your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work flats</a>, Banana Republic is the place to look. The company has a variety of office-appropriate silhouettes in more traditional, preppy styles that work well for both dressy and casual office environments (and can easily transition into an after-work drinks look). From satin shirt dresses to blazer dresses to sweater dresses, the company is a great resource for chic and sensible office attire. The one downside is that while the company does offer petite and tall sizes, the largest size the brand offers is XXL, so this isn't the place for anyone who needs plus or extended sizing, unfortunately.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size Range:</strong> XXS-XXL (regular, tall, and petite) | <strong>Shipping Policy:</strong> Free shipping over $50 | <strong>Return Policy:</strong> Return within 30 days of shipment date</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maternity-hatch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Maternity</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hatch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/U8SnUuciykReWNY-lxqb9MZrQTw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hatch-the-eliza-dress-75e5ac22382843a39baa2f20b55a2c29.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For expecting mothers, Hatch is a fantastic place to find stylish pieces that fit a growing baby bump. The brand offers more casual, everyday looks that are perfect for staying comfortable throughout your trimesters (although they don't offer formalwear dresses). We love it because the collection is super easy to shop, as you can find styles based on your trimester as well as size. The brand also has a collection of postpartum essentials, including styles such as nursing dresses, nightgowns, and other comfortable styles.

For a more modern spin on a cocktail dress, Lenkin recommends a classy floral maxi dress in a silk chiffon fabric.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What makes a dress office-appropriate?</span></p><p>“A perfect dress to wear to the office is anything that isn’t too short, so you can sit comfortably in it,” says Romero. “I think you should be able to show your personality in office clothes and have some fun with it, though." To do so, Romero recommends looking at colors, patterns, and different necklines to mix it up. “It comes down to the accessories for executing a look and making it look super-polished,” she adds.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the difference between cocktail and formal attire?</span></p><p>“It used to be that cocktail attire was shorter, and formal attire was longer, but that is no longer the case,” says Lenkin. She says a short dress can be the perfect ensemble for a formal event, just like Reese Witherspoon once demonstrated on the Golden Globe Awards red carpet in her knee-length, bright yellow Nina Ricci dress. “Rather than get your guidance from the ‘formal’ or ‘cocktail’ descriptors, plug into other adjectives that resonate with the way you want to feel at the event, and then align your dress to express these words,” Lenkin recommends. “An elegant, sophisticated, or glamorous dress will work well for many occasions.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word for It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has written for publications such as Byrdie, InStyle, The Spruce, and NYLON.
