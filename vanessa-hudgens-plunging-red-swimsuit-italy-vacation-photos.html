The actress looked stunning as she posed on a yacht in Italy while wearing a plunging underwire WeWoreWhat one-piece swimsuit. The red bathing suit featured spaghetti straps, a cool blue and white pattern, and a tiny belt that cinched in her tiny waist. She accessorized her swimsuit with a silk head wrap and sunglasses.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Vanessa’s outfits while in Italy have been amazing and just the other day she rocked a yellow, blue, and red triangle <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>patterned bikini</a>. The swimsuit featured an underwire top and high-waisted string bottoms and on top of her suit, she rocked an oversized linen chambray cover-up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She topped her look with the same silk headscarf and sunglasses but then later swapped her headwrap for a straw beach hat which she wore as she frolicked into the ocean to meet her mom and lounge on a turtle pool float. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Sun girl At it again. Feat. Mama g and turtle.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Another one of our favorite looks from Vanesa was her short-sleeve pastel pink <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mini dress</a> with white lace trim around the neckline and cutouts on the chest that was held together with bows. Later that day, she donned a slinky black button-down midi Heartloom Darcey Dress with a slit on the side, styled with a headwrap, a Telfar Shopper Bag, and nude mule heels.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49rZq%2BZnprAtK2Moaydn5WjwG68y66loKGenHqzscNmqrChnajCqsCMoquapKliw6KvwK2gqKZdpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
