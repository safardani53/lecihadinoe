Bob showed an early talent for entertainment by making movies with a Super 8 camera at age 9. Initially, Bob wanted to study medicine but was encouraged to pursue the arts. Bob developed his comedy skills at Temple University before&nbsp;enrolling&nbsp;in the University of Southern California’s film school in 1978. He quit soon after starting. He spent the following years on the comedy club circuit in Los Angeles, before his big break in 1987, when he joined CBS’s The Morning Program to add humor to the show. After six months, he was fired, but would find his greatest success later that year when he was cast as Danny Tanner on&nbsp;Full House. In 1989, Bob was cast as the host of&nbsp;America’s Funniest Home Videos. He would stay with the show until&nbsp;1997, often working on both AFV and Full House at the same time. After Full House&nbsp;was cancelled and he left AFV, Bob returned to the stand-up circuit, shedding his family friendly image. He would return to television with a handful of roles in the early 2000’s before getting cast as the narrator on the CBS hit sitcom, How I Met Your Mother. In addition to acting and comedy, Bob has directed films, including the television movie For Hope and the feature film&nbsp;Dirty Work, starring <strong>Norm Macdonald</strong>. His current projects include a role in the upcoming movie&nbsp;Killer Set&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Full House&nbsp;revival announced in 2015.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Bob is best known for his role as Danny Tanner in the sitcom Full House&nbsp;and his raunchy stand-up comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Bob married <strong>Sherry Kramer</strong> in 1983.
