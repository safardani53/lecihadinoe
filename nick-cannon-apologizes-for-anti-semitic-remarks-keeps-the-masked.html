bigot.</p><p>Though he initially <a href=#>defended his appalling remarks</a>, he has finally seen fit to issue a lengthy apology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/nick-cannon-in-a-pink-turban-803x1024.jpg><p>Nick Cannon took to Twitter and Instagram on Wednesday evening to express his regrets.</p><p>“First and foremost,” he began, “I extend my deepest and most sincere apologies to my Jewish sisters and brothers.”</p><p>Nick affirmed that he was apologizing “for the hurtful and divisive words that came out of my mouth during my interview with Richard Griffin.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">They reinforced the worst stereotypes of a proud and magnificent people,” Nick acknowledged.</span></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“And,” he wrote, “I feel ashamed of the uninformed and naïve place that these words came from.”</span></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Nick added: “The video of this interview has since been removed.</span>“</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“While the Jewish experience encompasses more than 5,000 years and there is so much I have yet to learn,” Nick noted.</p><p>He continued: “I have had at least a minor history lesson over the past few days.” Yes, we would certainly imagine so.</p><p>“And,” Nick wrote, “to say that it is eye-opening would be a vast understatement.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I want to express my gratitude to the Rabbis, community leaders, and institutions who reached out to me,” Nick expressed.</p><p>He acknowledged that they reached out “to help enlighten me.”</p><p>Nick appreciated that they found a way to inform him in an affirming way “instead of chastising me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/nick-cannon-at-a-screening-1004x1024.jpg><p>“I want to assure my Jewish friends, new and old, that this is only the beginning of my education,” Nick vowed.</p><p>“I am committed to deeper connections, more profound learning, and strengthening the bond between our two cultures,” he declared.</p><p>Nick continued by stating that this is the case “today and every day going forward.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“I just had the blessed opportunity to converse with Rabbi Abraham Cooper director of global social action @SimonWiesenthal,” Nick shared.</p><p>He wrote: “My first words to my brother was, I apologize for the hurt I caused the Jewish Community….”</p><p>That is an extremely good apology for him to make.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“On my podcast,” Nick confessed, “I used words & referenced literature I assumed to be factual to uplift my community.”</p><p>These references “instead turned out to be hateful propaganda and stereotypical rhetoric that pained another community”</p><p>“For this I am deeply sorry,” Nick expressed, “but now together we can write a new chapter of healing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Morning radio family,” Nick announced, “I have decided to take some time away from my radio show.”</p><p>He explained thta she is doing this “so I can commit myself to deeper, more thorough reflection and education.”</p><p>That sounds like it may be for the best.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I will use this time to establish an action plan towards real, impactful change and advocacy aimed at bringing people together,” Nick revealed.</p><p>He added: “I continue to express my gratitude to the Rabbis, community leaders, and institutions who have reached out to me to help enlighten me.”</p><p>There are educational resources at your disposal if you want to learn about things. Ideally, you want to learn before you talk about them as a celebrity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Their input and friendship will help me,” Nick acknwoeldged, “as I further commit myself to more profound learning.”</p><p>He continued: “and towards strengthening the bond between the Black and Jewish cultures every day going forward.”</p><p>Cynics may say that Nick had a publicist write this for him, but this seems like sincere and well said apology and it’s exactly what we had hoped to see.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Not coincidentally, Fox has announced that Nick can remain the host of The Masked Dancer, a show that sounds like a fake show that would exist on 30 Rock but is somehow real.</p><p>In a statement, Fox noted that Nick appeared genuinely remorseful and had offered an apology and had taken steps to learn.</p><p>This was a huge step up from his conversation with ViacomCBS, whose statement accused him of not even acknowledging the anti-Semitism that he had uttered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A lot can change in just a few days.</p><p>Nick’s statements in the interview had echoed both classic anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and a concept called Hebrew Israelism, which is both anti-Semitic and anti-African.</p><p>We wish Nick luck on his journey of education and enlightenment and we hope that this opportunity proves to be educational for his fans.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2WEcLrInKJmm5Gju7C6jJqnqKSfnLa7sdJmnaiqXZa7tbWMrJymoaSesG6%2BxKaYq6OjYrimsc%2BsZK2glWK6or%2FKnpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
