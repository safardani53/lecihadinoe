Little was born in Newport, Rhode Island, and lived most of his time in the San Francisco area, where his father was a senior military officer. Little is one of the most dominant amateurs in the history of the sport, winning both British amateurs and American amateurs, which were then considered back-to-back major championships in 1934 and 1935. He remains the only player to have won both titles in the same year more than once. Little's win ratios of 14 and 13 in the 1934 England final are still a dominance record. Bob Dickson, Harold Hilton and Bobby Jones are the only other golfers to have won both titles in the same year. Little graduated from Stanford University in 1934 and was a member of the Stanford Athlete Hall of Fame. He won the James E. The Sullivan Prize for Outstanding Amateur Athlete in 1935. Little was a pupil of golf coach Ernest Jones.</p><table class=wikibox readability=10><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Full name</td><td class=wk_value>William Lawson Little Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Nickname</td><td class=wk_value>Cannonball</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>June 23, 1910, Fort Adams, Newport, Rhode Island</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>February 1, 1968, Monterey, California</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Spouse</td><td class=wk_value>Dorothy Hurd (m. 1936-1968)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>Linda, Sandra, Sonya, William Lawson III</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>College</td><td class=wk_value>Stanford University</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Turned professional</td><td class=wk_value>1936</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Former tour(s)</td><td class=wk_value>PGA Tour</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Professional wins</td><td class=wk_value>9</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>PGA Tour</td><td class=wk_value>8</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Masters Tournament</td><td class=wk_value>T3: 1939</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>U.S. Open</td><td class=wk_value>Won: 1940</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>The Open Championship</td><td class=wk_value>T4: 1935</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>PGA Championship</td><td class=wk_value>T17: 1946, 1951</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>U.S. Amateur</td><td class=wk_value>Won: 1934, 1935</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>British Amateur</td><td class=wk_value>Won: 1934, 1935</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>World Golf Hall of Fame</td><td class=wk_value>1980 (member page)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>James E.
