However, overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.’ I had a sudden change of plans this week that affected us all.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>His message continued, “Two days ago, I was just back from a trip to the Bahamas, thawing out from the California ‘winter tour’ and chomping at the bit to get to Charleston. I had to stop in Boston for a check-up but wound up back in the hospital to address some issues that needed immediate attention. Growing old is not for sissies, I promise you. I will also promise you, that when I am well enough to perform, that is what I’ll be doing in the land of She-Crab soup.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jimmy-Buffet-Health-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“You all make my life more meaningful and fulfilled than I would have ever imagined as a toe-headed little boy sitting on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico,” he added at the time. “Thank you for your prayers and thoughts, your amazing years of loyalty, and just remember, ‘NOT YET!'”</p><h2>Was Jimmy Buffett Sick?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>The singer never disclosed specific details about his health. In September 2022, he had to postpone the remainder of his Flipside – Redux Tour. “Due to health issues and brief hospitalization, Jimmy will need to refrain from touring for the rest of the year. On doctor’s orders, he must take this time to recuperate and heal,” a message on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> read at the time. “Jimmy looks forward to getting back on stage next year.” Three dates – two in Las Vegas and one in San Diego – were rescheduled, while dates in Salt Lake City, UT, and Nampa, ID, were canceled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jimmy-Buffet-Health-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>&nbsp;</strong>At the time, it was just a setback in Jimmy’s exciting life. He was a road warrior, having toured relentlessly throughout his fifty-year career. He opened up about a few close calls he had in life during a past interview with Rolling Stone. In 1994, he crashed a Grumman G-44 Widgeon twin-engine aircraft while attempting to take off in the waters of Nantucket, Massachusetts. He was able to escape with just minor injuries, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the Buffett World website</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jimmy has maintained a positive attitude about his mortality despite the recurring health issues. “When you’ve had a couple of close calls — an airplane crash, a stage dive — you think you’re probably living on borrowed time,” he told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone </a>in 2020. “So I kind of do choose to live like it’s my last day. You never know. At [his age], you’re losing a lot of friends, and it’s a constant progression towards … y’know, what’s there. Everybody goes at some point.”</p><h2>Jimmy Buffett’s Cause of Death</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>His cause of death has not been disclosed by his wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jane Slagsvol</strong></a>, or his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three children</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jimmy-Buffet-Health-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>The “It’s 5 O’Clock Somewhere” singer previously talked about his long career, including how he cut back on partying as he got older.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“They call it ‘take the money and run’ shows, where you may not feel your best, and the audience won’t know it, because they’re so happy to be there. But I feel terrible when those things happen. I never wanted to do another [show like that]. And it scared me to death,” he previously told Rolling Stone. “You think you’re bulletproof. You’re in rock & roll. Drugs or sex — everything was around. But I didn’t want to make my family ashamed of me. And that was a very strong deterrent; it helped me make that change in my life at that time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>When asked how Jimmy wanted to be remembered, he said this:” ‘He had a good time and made a lot of people happy’ would be good.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mipKaxXZfCp7LEratmoJWWubW0jG5oaWtgaH5w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
