After spending weeks looking like the late I Love Lucy star, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> looked more like <strong>Julia Roberts </strong>in Hook with the hairstyle she debuted on Instagram on July 22. The 54-year-old actress had ditched her strawberry blonde locks for a bright red pixie cut. “On set,” she captioned the photo, which showed her posing on the set of her new Apple+ TV series, Roar, after an apparent storm. The rains had subsided, leaving a vivid rainbow that was almost as bright as Nicole’s hair color. Not one to miss a perfect opportunity, Nicole posed in front of the light show, as if she was the one casting the rainbow out of her new ‘do.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>This new chapter in Nicole’s hair journey comes after she transported herself back to the 1990s, back when she had her breakthrough alongside <strong>Tom Cruise </strong>in Days of Thunder. The Australian icon took a selfie on the day she interviewed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chris Rock</strong></a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Variety, and her hair was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a mass of wavy curls</a> that fell way past her shoulders. This was a dramatic reset for two reasons: because Nicole usually wears her hair straight or wavy, and for weeks prior, the only time anyone saw Nicole, it was when she was filming &nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Being The Ricardos</a>, <strong>Aaron Sorkin</strong>’s new biopic about <strong>Lucile Ball </strong>and <strong>Desi Arnez</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Nicole-Kidman-Red-Pixie-Haircut-New-Movie-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>For weeks, fans were treated to pics of Nicole after she had changed herself to look like Lucille. In April, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the first photos of Nicole as Lucy</a> showed her in a bright orange wig, a cream-colored blouse, a pale green blazer, and brown slacks. A few weeks later, more photos emerged of Nicole with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>curly hair</a> as she walked next to <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Javier Bardem</a></strong>, the actor playing Desi to Nicole’s Lucy, dressed in a white tuxedo jacket, reminiscent of Desi’s outfit as Ricky Ricardo on I Love Lucy. At the start of May, Nicole was in full 1950s Lucy glam, wearing a sleep blue vest over a blush pink blouse with matching blue trousers. Her hair was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>as bright as the sun</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s unclear what Nicole’s new pixie cut means for her part on Roar. The project is an anthology series, adopted from <strong>Cecelia Ahern</strong>’s book of the same name, of “darkly comic feminist fables” starring Nicole Kidman (who will also executive produce), <strong>Cynthia Erivo</strong>, <strong>Merritt Wever,</strong> and <strong>Alison Brie. </strong>It’s the first series from GLOW creators <strong>Liz Fahive </strong>and <strong>Carly Mensch</strong>, and will focus on “genre-bending episodes, told from a uniquely female point of view,” per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vulture</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FrZqehk6S5pnnKopummZ5itaK10WanorCZmnqkwdNmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
