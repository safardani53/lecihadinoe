Continue reading to find out more about Elizabeth Tudor’s early life as well as several other aspects of Becoming Elizabeth, such as the narrative, actors, and more.</p><h2>Becoming Elizabeth on Starz: Elizabeth Tudor’s childhood, ascension to the throne, and other Details</h2><p>Elizabeth Tudor was born in Greenwich Palace on September 7, 1533, to King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. King Henry VIII’s second wife was Anne Boleyn. Tudor was declared an illegitimate child when her parents’ marriage was canceled after the execution of Anne Boleyn in 1536.&nbsp;After her father’s death, she was raised as an orphan throughout her adolescence, and Edward VI governed the nation until 1556. When her half-sister Mary I subsequently became Queen, Tudor was imprisoned for over a year for allegedly supporting Protestant insurgents.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elizabeth-Tudor-2.jpg alt="Elizabeth Tudor" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following Mary’s death in 1558, Tudor became Queen. With her dynamic leadership, she quickly climbed to prominence, and it was during her reign that some of the finest English literature and art were created, including works by William Shakespeare. When it came to religious and economic policy, she was usually seen as more moderate than her father. While many of her political and economic actions and policies continue to split historians and researchers, Elizabeth Tudor is usually considered one of England’s most powerful rulers and remains popular.</p><h2>The narrative and characters of Becoming Elizabeth</h2><p>Becoming Elizabeth tells the story of Elizabeth Tudor, who ascended to power when her father, King Henry VIII, died. According to the series’ description on Starz’s official YouTube channel:</p><p>“Becoming Elizabeth” follows young Elizabeth Tudor (Alicia von Rittberg), an orphaned adolescent who gets engaged in the political and sexual machinations of the English court as she seeks the throne. The death of King Henry VIII sets in motion a violent power struggle. His surviving offspring are pawns in a game between the great families of England and the European powers vying for control of the nation.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elizabeth-Tudor-3.jpg alt="Elizabeth Tudor" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The series is supposed to be a nuanced depiction of one of England’s most famous rulers. On April 21, 2022, a trailer for the program was released. It provides a glimpse into the harsh world of ambition and power in sixteenth-century England. Without giving too much away, the trailer brilliantly captures the core of the program.</p><p>The play stars Alicia von Rittberg as Elizabeth Tudor, with a supporting ensemble that includes Romola Garai as Mary I, Tom Cullen as Thomas Seymour, Jessica Raine as Catherine Parr, and many more. Anya Reiss, a well-known playwright, and screenwriter are in charge of the series. Becoming Elizabeth premieres on Starz on June 12, 2022.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGicpaGqlq%2BmwMdmq66cn6fAbrjIn5xmoaNivbC%2B06uYsp2UYravedOhnGatoJi8rrXNoGSdqpGirm6uxJympqGenHqmuMizmJudpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
