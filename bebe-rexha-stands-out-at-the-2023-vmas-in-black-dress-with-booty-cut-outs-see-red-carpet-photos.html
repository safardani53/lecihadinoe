Though Bebe exuded nothing but pure confidence, she previously opened up about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>feeling “anxious AF”</a> prior to attending to awards show.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I know that the criticism comes with the territory. Sometimes it does get to me. I am human,” she explained in a TikTok video on Monday, September 11. “Right now, I’m not feeling so confident. I am so anxious and stressed about going on the red carpet, and I guess people talking about my weight, because I’m not really loving myself right now. I’m not really feeling like the bad bitch that I usually am.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite feeling pressure, the “Meant to Be” songstress noted that she is “grateful” and “blessed” to be able to perform on stage and to be nominated.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I guess everybody has these days, and nobody ever feels perfect, and that’s why I wanted to make this video,” she explained before teasing the details of her dress.” I do have an outfit. It is cute, and I do want to wear my dress, and I do really want to go to celebrate my nomination and my friends’ nominations, but I do feel like anxiety gets the best of me. If you have any motivational tips or tricks, please share them with me. I genuinely want to know, and maybe you’ll see me on the red carpet tomorrow.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>This wasn’t the first time that Bebe has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>addressed her figure</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>self-confidence</a>. Over the summer, fans witnessed her breakup unfold with former boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Keyan Safyari</strong></a>. In early July, Bebe shared — then quickly deleted — a screenshot of a text message to her Instagram Stories, which appeared to be from Keyan. Though she did not confirm whether it came from him, the message criticized her weigh gain.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Hey, I never said you weren’t beautiful and I never said I didn’t love you,” the message read. “In fact, I said how beautiful you are and how much I loved you. But I always said I would be honest with you and your face was changing and I told you it was. That was the conversation we were having, and you asked.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5BrZpudkpp6s7HXoZhmq6SWu6W%2FjKisrWWRqXq1tMRmaWlqY2LDrq3SZqCnZZKhrqS3jJ2pnqujYsSqwMdmmainpK56pMHTZqaurKNiwKaxjKucnWWTlr%2BxsdNmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
