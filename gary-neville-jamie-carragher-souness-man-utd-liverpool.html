I said I thought first half Manchester United were the better team. I think that in the second half it was about Manchester United's capitulation."</p><p>Souness chimed back with: "So that had nothing to do with Liverpool playing well?"</p><p>Before Neville qualified his view, adding: "I don't think when Jurgen Klopp analyses that game tomorrow - the momentum from that he'll take - but I don't think he'll think 'we're back'.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>"I don't think he'll fall into that trap.

They're still not back anywhere near that level."</p><p>Carragher then asked Neville: "Did Liverpool play well today?"</p><p>Neville responded: "They played alright in the second half, no problem, they won the game 7-0. Congratulations."</p><p>Souness added: "You just said they didn't play very well!"</p><p>Neville replied: "My point is, when you get beat 7-0, it becomes about how bad the other team are.</p><p>"Manchester United in that second half - Luke Shaw, Varane, Martinez, Dalot, that midfield - they were an absolute shambles."</p><p>Carragher hit back by saying: "You've got to give credit to the team that win 7."</p><p>But a prickly Neville replied: "I've given you credit James. You've won 7-0. Congratulations you've got three points, well done."</p><p>Souness then said: "I've never heard him call you James before. You've got him. You've got him."</p><p>Neville replied: "You've got your three points and you're 7-0 and that's fine. But I still think Liverpool in that first-half were really vulnerable. That was a shaky Liverpool in that first half."</p><p>Souness attempted to dig further, adding: "So you think Man Utd were the better team in the first half?"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>And Neville replied: "I do."</p><p>Souness then finished the debate by saying: "Not a chance."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9ygo9raGlvX5yus8WMp5yvoZyhsm62wKagnmWTlr%2BzrcahnKtlo6TCr7HSrGSmmZ5iwrWwjKWgr52ipbywuI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
