But when the camera turns off, and he steps into reality, his life isn’t all that glitters. The whiskey lover has been in three different marital rides, though none of them can be tagged as ‘happily ever after.’</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>White’s First Two Marriages</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The 63-year-old stand-up comedian first walked down the aisle with Lori A Brice on August 1, 1981, in Caldwell County, Texas. White was 24 at the time, while Brice was 19. The couple had a son, Marshal White, before ending their marriage in 1993.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Nine years later, White shared marital vows with Barbara Dobbs, an interior designer by profession. The comic and his then-wife Dobbs&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lived together</a>&nbsp;in Atalanta and bought a $3.75 million single-level ocean-view house in Montecito in 2006. However, fate had something else in store for them as they parted ways just two years later in 2008. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Third Time Un-lucky</h2><p>After two unsuccessful marriages, White married singer-songwriter Margo Rey, on October 13, 2013. But even this marital relationship ended in a divorce, that too just four years after they shared their wedding vows.</p><p>The separation turned bitter after Rey&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed</a>&nbsp;her husband left her amidst her cancer remission. During the divorce, the 53-year-old said that White had canceled her credit card with no warning. The hit singer also alleged that White even changed the locks of their home.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On the other hand, the comedian asserted that he wasn’t legally wedded to the singer because they never agreed upon prenuptial conditions. However, an LA judge chose to side with Rey, ruling that her marriage to White was, in fact, under common law under the Texas constitution and that they had lived together as husband and wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>COVID-19 Impacted White’s Spousal Support Payments</h2><p>After the settlement, White eventually conceded to start paying $25,000 a month to his Mexican-born ex-wife, starting from November 2019. But the coronavirus pandemic constricted his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">financial course</a>. The global crisis took a toll on the comedian’s gigs, which ultimately led him to ask the authorities to stop the spousal support. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Now I cannot work. I have a tenth-grade education. I am 63. Margo still insists I pay her $25,000 per month. I have employees depending on me for wages and benefits. I do not even have $25,000 per month of income.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>As per the courtroom papers, White said that he didn’t even have a monthly income of $25,000, let alone pay that amount to Rey. The Texan funnyman even detailed his annual income and expenses—the former amounting to just over $300,000 while the latter being more than $433,000.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoqS7bsPHoqueZaees6Z5w6KtqKqTmnupwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
