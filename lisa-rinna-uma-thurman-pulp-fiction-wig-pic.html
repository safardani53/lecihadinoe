The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> star covered up <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her iconic short brunette shag</a> to look like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Uma Thurman</strong></a>‘s character from <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>‘s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>legendary 1994 flick Pulp Fiction</a>. She donned a short black bob wig with bangs to resemble Uma in the movie, and it was definitely intentional. The 57-year-old beauty wrote, “Hi Uma” as her caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Lisa took a pass on Uma’s classic white collared button-up blouse from the film in favor of a Versace robe. She kept her makeup simple and in neutrals, letting her gorgeous light brown eyes pop, along with the heavy lashes that swept against her bangs. Lisa’s plump pout was the center of attention, with a gorgeous nude shade.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/uma-thurman-pulp-fiction-everett-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=403 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lisa was trying to channel Uma Thurman in 1994’s ‘Pulp Fiction’ with her latest wig.

She’s primarily focusing on lip kits, lipsticks and glosses.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lisa-rinna-ap-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=930 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Lisa Rinna’s short brunette shag is itself iconic, as the actress has worn the look for years and it has become her trademark style. Photo credit: AP.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Oddly enough none of her fans seemed to think she looked like Uma in Pulp Fiction. Instead they thought she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> on first blush!! Lisa has been experimenting with different hairpieces and wigs lately via IG, which has caused fans to realize that she actually bears a strong facial resemblance to Kim, with her eyes and nose shape, bone structure and of course <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their equally puffy pouts</a>. Fan @kathyweissgerber told Lisa, “At 1st glance I thought I was looking at Kim K. Beautiful,” while @lainiewatts told Lisa that her “Uma has a Kardashian vibe going on and I’m here for it.” User @majohanson commented, “Kardashian for sure,” with a fire emoji.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>One fan even gave Lisa a new “K” first name <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to join the Kardashian fam</a>, with @stinamagee telling Lisa she’s “The long lost Kardashian sister…Kendra.” @jesstabibi wrote, “Hi Kim” in the comments as @emmajaneriley marveled, “omg i thought this was kim k.” Lisa celebrated the launch of her lip line with a half-up, half-down long bronde hair look thanks to a hairpiece in a Jan. 16 selfie. Next to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her IG selfie</a> from the event — even with a completely different color and style from her “Uma” — <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fans thought she was Kim’s twin</a>. We need to get these ladies in the same room with the same makeup artist STAT to see how close they can come to being each other’s clones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5BqZqWho5Z6s7XNp5hmrZ2WerW01KukmqZdpcKtvIyfoJysmaS7bsPIoGSpoZNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
