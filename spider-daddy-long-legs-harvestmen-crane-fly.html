Harvestmen, crane flies and cellar spiders explained The S</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>SPIDERS and daddy-long-legs are a familiar site in our households, often popping up unexpectedly in our bathrooms and kitchens.</p><p>Crane flies, harvestmen and cellar spiders are all known as daddy-long-legs - so what exactly are these creepy crawlies, and do they bite?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nintchdbpict000265098557.jpg><h2>Are daddy long-legs really spiders?</h2><p>The answer is actually more complex than you may have thought.</p><p>The name 'daddy long-legs' is used to refer to several different spiders, most often a crane fly, a cellar spider and harvestmen.</p><h3>Harvestmen</h3><p>The main use of the American word daddy long-legs is in fact an Opilione arachnid, known formally as harvestmen.</p><p>They're not spiders, although they look very similar and are sometimes known as harvesters or shepherd spiders.</p><p>Harvestmen can be found all over the world and are omnivorous - meaning they will eat anything they can get their claws on, including small insects, amphibians, dead animals and plant materials.</p><h3>Craneflies</h3><p>In the UK, the creature commonly referred to as a daddy-long-legs is in fact <strong>NOT</strong> a spider.</p><p>Brits generally use the word daddy-long-legs to refer to craneflies - long-legged winged insects which are not spiders.<br>As an insect, it has six legs, and again can be found around the world. They are considered an agricultural pest because the larvae will eat crops.</p><h3>Cellar spider</h3><p>Another type of spider that is sometimes referred to as a daddy-long-legs as a Pholcus phalangioides, or cellar spiders.</p><p>It lives in most places around the world but cannot survive in cold weather, so will often be found inhabiting the nooks and crannies of your warm house or the ceilings.</p><p>They are considered beneficial as they eat other, more dangerous spiders.</p><p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>Everything you need to know about spiders</h3></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000755623794-1.jpg><h2>Are daddy-long-legs poisonous?</h2><p>Craneflies and Opiliones, aka harvestmen, are not venomous at all and don't pose any threat to humans.</p><p>The daddy long-legs from the spider family, Pholcus phalangioides, do have venom glands, however, there is no scientific evidence to confirm that the venom is harmful to humans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nintchdbpict000265098555.jpg><h2>How do I get rid of daddy-long-legs in my home?</h2><p>Try to avoid them getting inside in the first place.</p><p>Seal the cracks and crevices around your windows and doors and keep windows shut or screened if you want to stop them&nbsp;getting inside.</p><p>Another <a href=#>spider-proofing tip</a> is to keep the plants and bushes around the perimeter of your house trimmed so that they have no place to hide and lay their eggs.</p><p>If you are still infested try spraying some bug spray around the entrances and openings to your property.</p><p>Some are considered nuisances, and some are not.</p><p>Cellar spiders are actually considered beneficial predators as they eat a variety of smaller insects as well as gobbling up faeces and carcasses.</p><p>If you find one of these indoors, try to catch it gently using your hand or glass and release it outside to continue its work cleaning up the environment.</p><p>Crane flies however are considered agricultural pests, as their larvae - known as leatherjackets - eat the roots and leaves of crops and ornamental plants.</p><h2>What are the differences between craneflies and spiders?</h2><p>Aside from their long spindly legs, there are actually very few similarities between craneflies and spiders.</p><p>The most obvious difference between the two is that craneflies have wings and are insects.</p><p>They also only have six legs and two eyes, unlike their eight-legged, eight-eyed cousins.</p><h2>What are the similarities between harvestmen and spiders?</h2><p>Both creatures belong to the arachnid family.</p><p>This means that they have eight legs and both scuttle in a similar fashion.</p><p>However, while from a distance the creatures appear very similar, that is where the shared characteristics end.</p><p>Harvestmen are considered ancient arachnids.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ NEWS</h2></p><h2>What are the differences between harvestmen and spiders?</h2><p>The main difference between harvestmen and spiders is that spiders have a distinctive waist.</p><p>With harvestmen, the head, thorax and abdomen are all fused into one.</p><p>Additionally, spiders have eight eyes, whereas harvestmen only have two.</p><p>Another big difference between the creatures is that harvestmen don't produce silk and so can't create webs.</p><p>Interestingly, harvestmen also produce a smell when threatened and even weirder still, while spiders reproduce indirectly, harvestmen do in fact have penises.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
