A source told Us that the actor, 65, proposed to Savoie, 26, with a <a href=#>vintage engagement ring</a> designed by <strong>Giorgio Bulgari</strong>.</p><p>“Giorgio met Savoie and Quaid in Tuscany, and then later in the week they were planning to travel to Geneva, where he lives with his family,” the source revealed. “They all had dinner in Geneva and Giorgio showed them stones — Laura’s ring is the last one he showed them.”</p><p>The source told Us that the ring is “an old mine-cut cushion diamond that’s estimated to be five centuries old.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Nathsha-Richardson-Lindsay-Lohan-and-Dennis-Quaid-in-The-Parent-Trap.jpg><p>The Day After Tomorrow star <a href=#>confirmed the news of his engagement</a> during an interview with Extra on Monday, October 21.</p><p>“It was kind of spontaneous. It was very much a surprise,” he said. “I had the ring in my pocket. … It has been kind of a month-and-a-half plan. … [Laura was] actually taking a selfie of us, and I put the ring in front and said, ‘Will you marry me?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Quaid later told Entertainment Tonight that Savoie is a “beautiful, beautiful woman” before gushing, “I’m really as happy as I can be.”</p><p>Us confirmed in June that the <a href=#>spouses-to-be were an item</a>.
