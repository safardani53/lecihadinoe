That’s how sort of easy a decision it was for me and us,” the O.C alum, 43, said during a Wednesday, March 8, appearance on Sirius XM’s “The Jess Cagle Show.”</p><p>Brody continued: “I was never scared of the idea of marriage or kids. It always seemed like a route I would go [down] eventually, and I was excited to when it came together [and] <a href=#>when I met the right person.”</a></p><p>The Thank You for Smoking actor got to know Meester, 36, on the set of their 2011 movie The Oranges, but the pair actually met years earlier when <strong>Josh Schwartz</strong> — who produced both The O.C. and <a href=#>Gossip Girl </a>— introduced them.</p><p>“That whole <a href=#>[Gossip Girl] cast</a> was eating at Canter’s [Deli in Los Angeles] and I lived at Canter’s for, like, my entire 20s. And I was leaving, and [Josh] introduced all of us,” Brody recalled during a March 2021 appearance on <a href=#><strong>Anna Faris</strong></a>‘ “Unqualified” podcast.”</p><p>He added of Meester — who <a href=#>played Blair Waldorf</a> on the CW series — “I had no idea whether she was a good person or not. And, in fact, kind of assumed she probably wasn’t for, like, the first handful of years that I didn’t know her, just because, I don’t know, [her character on] Gossip Girl.”</p><p>The pair’s connection didn’t turn romantic until about a year after they filmed The Oranges. In February 2013, Us Weekly broke the news that <a href=#>the actors were dating</a>. One year later, the <a href=#>Gilmore Girls alum</a> and the Roommate actress tied the knot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Adam-Brody-Says-Whirlwind-Marriage-to-Leighton-Meester-Was-an-%E2%80%98Easy-Decision-1.jpg><p>The twosome later revealed that they “occasionally” talk about the fact that their <a href=#>iconic teen drama characters</a> ended up together in real life.</p><p>“Once a year, <a href=#>randomly, on our Seth and Blair day,</a>” Meester quipped during a June 2017 joint <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> interview with her husband. “It’s good for a laugh. It doesn’t excite us, I think, because we’re just human beings … but it’s exciting to us that it’s exciting to you. It’s cool.”</p><p>The couple went on to welcome <a href=#>daughter Arlo</a> in 2015 and <a href=#>a son</a> — whose name the two have not publicly released — in 2020. The Monte Carlo actress gushed about Brody’s parenting skills during a March 2022 Access Interview.</p><p>“He’s <a href=#>everything that I imagined he would be as a father</a> when we [first] decided to have kids. It is really amazing,” she shared.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brody, for his part, called his wife <a href=#>a “heavenly creature”</a> during his March 2021 “Unqualified” appearance.</p><p>“She’s literally like Joan of Arc. She is, like, the strongest, best person I know. She is my moral compass and north star, and I just can’t say enough good things about her character. It’s crazy,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaanJGieqO%2Bzp2wZqWRp7%2B6tc2gZKWdmZy1tbvNZqSenaOpsrN5xZqqrWWnlsBurc1mnJqrqWKxpq%2FIrKCopl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
