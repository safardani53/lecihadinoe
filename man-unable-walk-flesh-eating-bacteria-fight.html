"I couldn’t walk, it was very warm and very painful."</p><p>Later, Adams was taken to the emergency room at HCA Florida Pasadena Hospital in St. Petersburg.</p><p>Dr. Fritz Brink, an osteopathic physician at HCA Florida, said that after observing Adams' leg, he knew he had to act fast.</p><p>"I looked at him, and I said to him that I need to take you to the operating room,” Brink recalled.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>doctor</a> continued to explain that he found necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating bacteria that destroys healthy tissue in the body.</p><p>It enters through a break in the skin, which was a bite in Adams' case and can originate from several different bacteria, per the <a href=# aria-label="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).</p><p>“There’s a lot of really bad bacteria that live between our teeth in our gums in our mouth,” Brink told the news outlet, as he believed the bacteria could have come from the teeth of the person who bit Adams.</p><p>Brink had to perform surgery twice to remove additional infected tissue from Adams' thigh and managed to save the Tampa Bay resident's leg.</p><p>“If I would’ve waited … until the next day after that ER second visit, there was a good chance I would’ve lost my leg,” Adams said.</p><p>Had he waited an additional day to go in, the outcome could have also been fatal, as septic shock might have set in.</p><p>Brink explained that infections evolve rapidly, and any person with open wounds should watch for signs of it worsening and seek <a href=#>medical attention</a> immediately.</p><p>Redness, increased pain, or warmth are all symptoms.</p><p>For Adams, the situation was horrific, but he is incredibly thankful.</p><p>“They assessed my wound and it was very horrific,” he said.</p><p>“It was unbelievable. But in my mind, I just had to get through whatever this was.”</p><p>“What you see now, you see not just a scar, but the beauty of the aftermath,” Adams continued.</p><p>“I would’ve never imagined that a human bite would turn into something so horrific as a flesh-eating bacteria.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>For more related content, check out The U.S. Sun's coverage of an urgent warning for summer vacationers as <a href=#>flesh-eating bacteria has washed up on hotspot beaches.</a></p><p>The U.S. Sun also has the story of a woman who lost half of her face <a href=#>after a flesh-eating bug attacked it.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/horrific-man-left-unable-walk-823645706.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIV0fpVpa29nnZa7bsHNmpmlnV2srq23jJ%2BjnquYYrKiwMinnmaakZjBpr7ImmSfoZedwXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
