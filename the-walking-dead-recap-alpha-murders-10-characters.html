We followed them through a few years as they became members of the settlement … right until their final breath.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It was fitting that they died on the way to the fair given that it was teased as the big event to unite the communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Alpha used one of the women’s scalps as a disguise when she later found her way into King Ezekiel’s big fair. It was a truly unsettling moment, but it was nothing compared to what was coming.&nbsp;</p><p>Ezekial gave a speech to the four communities that included shout-outs to the likes of Rick, Carl, and even Shiva. He was ready to embrace this new life with everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>But Henry was still missing, and Carol later revealed she would be the one to go looking for him because, well, the King could not be missing from the big festivities.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The good news is that Henry, Daryl, Michonne, Connie, Lydia, Michonne, Judith, and Dog showed up at the gates right before a group left the fair to find them.&nbsp;</p><p>“You can’t ever run away like that again,” Carol told Henry.&nbsp;</p><p>Ezekiel then held a meeting with Michonne, Gabriel, Tara, Rachel, and Carol.&nbsp;</p><p>Gabriel told everyone that Alexandria would be granting asylum to Lydia. Tara was against it because it meant Alpha would retaliate.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Michonne made Lydia remember that she was given the benefit of the doubt all those years ago, and without leaders taking chances, neither of them would be in a position of power.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Lydia didn’t choose where she came from… she chose where she wanted to be,” she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Michonne said that the four communities had to work together to take down this threat and that if she hurt one of them, she was waging war on all four.&nbsp;</p><p>When it came to signing the charter, Michonne gave her title to Gabriel because she felt like it was time he was the head of Alexandria’s council.&nbsp;</p><p>Ezekiel and Carol later chatted about the fact that Henry was taking a girl to the movies, while Luke turned to Enid to find out how he could get Alden to sing a song with him at the fair.&nbsp;</p><p>Enid then referred to Alden as her boyfriend, and it seemed like there was a new love story here.&nbsp;</p><p>Daryl, Carol, Magna, Yumiko, Dianne, and Marco then set out to reinforce The Hilltop.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When the group came across the Highwaymen, they decided to split up with the aim of finding the others.</p><p>Before long, Daryl, Michonne, and Yumiko were surrounded by Whisperers.&nbsp;</p><p>"You just had to give me the girl,” sighed Beta. “Now that deal… is done.”</p><p>Back at the fair, it was still daylight, and Alpha was doing the rounds. She ultimately sat next to Tara in the movie theater.&nbsp;</p><p>Alpha told everyone back at the woods that Lydia was no longer a concern. Alpha took Daryl away and showed him a huge heard that any of her workers could send to any of the settlements they want.&nbsp;</p><p>Alpha warned that he and his people had to stay within their areas or they would be killed. She said that the border was clearly marked.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Daryl left with Michonne, Carol, and Yumiko and they went up a hill to the border wall. They found stakes with the heads of some of our key players.&nbsp;</p><p>Among them were Highwaymen Ozzy and Alek, DJ, Frankie, Tammy Rose, Addy and Rodney, and then our more prominent players, Enid, Tara, and Henry.</p><p>Siddiq later told the story about a fight the people who died took part in.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think [Alpha] left me alive to tell you that story, to scare you and drive us all apart again,” he said.</p><p>“But I wanna tell you a different story” — one of heroism, in which even strangers fought together as if they were family. “We have to keep going, for them and for all of us,” he concluded.</p><p>“We need to honor them.”</p><p>Daryl and Lydia later visited the pikes, and snow started to fall. We’re in for a terrible winter, you guys!</p><p>What did you think of this wild installment?</p><p>Hit the comments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Walking Dead continues Sundays on AMC.&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Walking Dead Season 9: What’s About to Go Down?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WAcMDHnmSwmZygtq%2BzjJ2cmpxdp7Kkrc9mmKWomJZ6rsHRnZyrq11mfW6vx5qpmpukmr%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
