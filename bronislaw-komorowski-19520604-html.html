Komorowski served as Minister of Defence from 2000 to 2001. As Marshal of the Sejm, Komorowski exercised the powers and duties of head of state following the death of President Lech Kaczyński in a plane crash on 10 April 2010. Komorowski was then the governing Civic Platform party's candidate in the resulting presidential election, which he won in the second round of voting on 4 July 2010. He was sworn in as President on 6 August 2010. Komorowski thus became the second person to serve on two occasions as Polish head of state since 1918, after Maciej Rataj. On 25 May 2015, Komorowski conceded the presidency of Poland to the rival candidate Andrzej Duda, after the latter won the second round of the 2015 presidential election.</p><table class=wikibox readability=10.5><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Bronisław Maria Komorowski, June 4, 1952, Oborniki Śląskie, Poland</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Political party</td><td class=wk_value>Democratic Union, Freedom Union, Conservative People's Party, Civic Platform, Independent</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Spouse(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Anna Dziadzia</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>Zofia Aleksandra, Tadeusz Jan, Maria Anna, Piotr Zygmunt, Elżbieta Jadwiga</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Alma mater</td><td class=wk_value>University of Warsaw</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Preceded by</td><td class=wk_value>Lech Kaczyński (As President), Grzegorz Schetyna</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Succeeded by</td><td class=wk_value>Andrzej Duda</td></tr></table><p>Politician Bronislaw Komorowski was born on June 4, 1952 in Poland (He's 71 years old now).</p><p>He was a member of the Independent, Civic Platform, and Conservative People's Parties at various times during his political career before becoming President of Poland in 2010.
