It sounded like fun.”</p><p class=p1>Probst, now 61, was hired to helm <a href=#>CBS’ survivalist competition series</a>, which premiered in 2000, before Keoghan got the call to host <i>The Amazing Race </i>the following year. The New Zealand native further teased to <i>Us </i>that <a href=#>the two TV presenters</a> still joke about going up for the same job.</p><p class=p1>“We were calling each other during that time [too and asking,] ‘Have you heard anything?’” Keoghan said. “And we’re both at CBS [now], of course, and <a href=#>we are, I think, in the right place</a>.”</p><p class=p1>Keoghan and Probst <a href=#>first crossed paths way before</a> the <i>Survivor</i> auditions.</p><p class=p1>“[Our friendship] actually goes back to New York City almost 30 years ago, back to 1994 when we were both working at FX in Madison Square Park, where there was a living breathing apartment studio,” he reminisced on Wednesday. “And <a href=#><strong>Tom Bergeron</strong></a> was hosting a show called <i>Breakfast Time</i> and I was working on that show and Jeff worked on a show called <i>Back Chat</i> and he would read letters from people. We have a longstanding history of following each other through the industry.”</p><p class=p1>While Keoghan narrowly missed out on <a href=#>hosting <i>Survivor</i></a>, he isn’t quite sure how he would have fared in the island environment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Phil-Keoghan-Still-Jokes-With-Jeff-Probst-About-Losing-Survivor-Job-2.jpg><p class=p1>“Well, after <a href=#>45 seasons they’ve done now</a>, I’m not sure how I would’ve done with that,” he jokingly told <i>Us</i>. “I love <i>Amazing Race </i>for the fact that<a href=#> we are moving</a> … [and] just to be able to have that change and just a variation of environment. I love it.”</p><p class=p1>Now that Keoghan and Probst have landed where they are meant to, they are “teaming up to own Wednesday nights,” he added. The latest seasons of <i>Survivor</i> and<i> The Amazing Race</i>, which both premiered on Wednesday, air back-to-back on CBS.</p><p class=p1>The <i>Amazing Race</i> — currently on its 35th season — features <a href=#>plenty of new twists</a> from a “supersized” episode length of 90 minutes, <a href=#>a larger cast of contestants</a> (starting with 13 teams) and new travel destinations.</p><p class=p1>“We’re starting in Los Angeles under the Hollywood sign, which is celebrating a hundred years,” Keoghan teased to <i>Us</i>. “We fly [from there] to Bangkok, we get to India, <a href=#>we travel extensively</a> through Asia. We get to Europe, we’ll get to Ireland and a place that we’ve never been to before is Slovenia, [which is] next to Italy. … [It’s a] beautiful spot.”</p><p class=p1>For the CBS personality, Slovenia was his “favorite place” of season 35. “I’d never been there before. I’ve been to 140 countries, [but] I had not been to Slovenia,” he gushed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>New episodes of <i>The Amazing Race</i> airs on CBS Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapoJmheqyxzqCfmqZdqMGquMtmoaijlah6uLXToWSjnZaberG%2BzpuqrWWRl7y2wIylpqyhnpx6tMHRr6Cvp6Jit7Cujg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
