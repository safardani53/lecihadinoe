One of the hit home remodeling reality series was resurrected by the home and interior decoration channel, and this season has proven to be more fascinating than the previous three editions.</p><p>Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, this season. Four HGTV teams battle for bragging rights and the opportunity to have a street named after them in the lower country. Furthermore, HGTV has introduced its own twist to the series in season 3 to make it more entertaining.</p><p>The reality television show’s participant pairs are made up of siblings, spouses, or domestic partners. Ty Pennington is returned as the new season’s host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Rock-The-Block.-1.jpeg><h2>A Preview Of Rock The Block Season 3 Episode 4 As Well As A Recap</h2><p>The participants will confront a new task in episode 4 of Rock The Block. In the episode F.R.O.G. Showdown, they’ll have to rebuild a whole new location. This will air on HGTV on Monday, March 21, 2022, at 9.00 p.m. ET.</p><p>On HGTV, the show’s official bio reads:</p><p>“The teams head upstairs to refurbish the FROG, a new venue for Rock the Block. The teams have only a few days to alter their Finished Room Over Garage before Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent assess their work, so they’re hoping to be ahead of the pack.”</p><p>All four teams competed in a remodeling task in episode 3 of the show. In an episode dubbed Main Suites Showdown, the teams had to restore and refurbish the main bedroom suites. Rock the Block veteran Alison Victoria and HGTV star Page Turner graded the teams on a test of luxury vs. usefulness.</p><p>Unsellable Houses’ twin sisters Leslie Davis and Lyndsay Lamb won the competition with their brilliantly planned and created bedroom and closet.</p><p>Hunter Quinn Homes developed the residences that require work this season in Berkeley County’s Nexton neighborhood in South Carolina. The four teams were given a basic house with a market value of $250,000. These four teams are in charge of renovating and redesigning these residences in order to raise their pricing.</p><p>Other cast members include Detroit-based flippers Keith Bynum and Evan Thomas (Bargain Block), Egypt Sherrod and her builder husband, Mike Jackson (Married to Real Estate), and Arkansas house rehab gurus Dave and Jenny Marrs (Married to Real Estate) (Fixer to Fabulous).</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Season 3 Episode 4 Of Rock The Block</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoZ2eYsSquMtmqp6Zo6S7bn%2BMnqeiq5%2BZsm6AjKidZqqfmLhuwMeeZJukn5i4bq3Iq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
