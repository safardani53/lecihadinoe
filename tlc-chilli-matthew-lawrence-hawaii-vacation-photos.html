The iconic pop singer, 51, and the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Boy Meets World star,</a> 42, lounged around on the sands of Waikiki while deep in conversation before taking a dip together in the crystal blue waters. The pair was all smiles as Chilli looked incredible in her simple yet chic bikini, and Matthew cut a fit figure in his dark swim shorts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Chili-TLC-And-Matthew-Lawrence-tmz-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>As for any romance heating up between the photogenic duo, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>reported that the seaside jaunt was only platonic, and nothing is brewing at the moment. A source told the outlet that Chilli was on the tropical island to perform a show and “Matthew and some pals came to watch.” According to the insider, the pair are merely “friends” and decided to hang out after she finished the concert.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The eyebrow-raising beach day comes only six months after news broke that Matthew had split with his wife of three years, Dancing with the Stars pro <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cheryl Burke</strong></a>. “I know I have always said I’m an open book with you guys, I do strive to be, and in writing this I’ve realized there really isn’t an easy way to announce that my marriage is ending,” Cheryl, 37, wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on February 24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Chili-TLC-And-Matthew-Lawrence-tmz-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>She and Matthew tied the knot in May 2019 after being engaged for a year. According to the divorce docs obtained by HollywoodLife, Cheryl listed their date of separation as Jan. 7 with “irreconcilable differences” as the reason. Notably, their marriage came almost a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>decade after they broke up</a> during their first round of dating, which lasted two years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meanwhile, Chilli has not been linked publicly with anyone recently. The “Scrubs” singer has had her share of high-profile relationships in the past, however.&nbsp; She dated producer Dallas Austin throughout the 90s and has a child with him. From 2001 to 2004, she and Usher were a hot item. Chilli’s also been linked to <strong>Wayne Brady </strong>and<strong> Nick Cannon</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Chili-TLC-And-Matthew-Lawrence-tmz-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I’ve been in love, I’ve had heartbreak and I just made a choice to not want to deal with that,” she said on VH-1’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Girls Cruise</a> in 2019. ‘I love being a mom and working, and if one day I meet this most amazing man to be a part of my happiness then that would be amazing.
