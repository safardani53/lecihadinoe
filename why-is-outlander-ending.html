Season 7 of Outlander, which is set to debut sometime in summer 2023, will have 16 episodes in total. Given that each episode is roughly around one hour, that means we have 16 hours of Outlander content this year!</p><p>The eighth and final season of Outlander will sadly only have 10 episodes, but what's a season of Outlander without a dose of intense pain, sorrow, and some bad wigs? (OK, maybe the whole Claire getting arrested for the murder of Malva thing was worse, but you get the point!)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wait, did Claire actually murder Malva? (SPOILERS)</h2><p>Season 6 of Outlander ended with a bang (literally — Jamie and Claire got in a firefight with Richard Brown and his obnoxious committee of safety). Claire was arrested for the murder of Malva Christie (Jessica Reynolds), but there's no way Claire actually murdered Malva, right?</p><p>It was Adso the cat, obviously.

(Is it about Murtagh?)</h2><p>Sadly, we're not getting a Murtagh prequel (hey, the future is still full of possibilities). However, Starz has officially greenlit a prequel titled Outlander: Blood of My Blood.</p><p>The prequel will tell the story of Jamie's parents, Brian Fraser and Ellen MacKenzie. Outlander showrunner Matthew B. Roberts teased in an official statement that "there will be several names and faces that Outlander fans will know and recognize" in the prequel series.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the final season of Outlander will be based on Diana's eighth Outlander novel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Written in My Own Heart's Blood</a>.
