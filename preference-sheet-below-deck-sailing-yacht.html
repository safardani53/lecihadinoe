It depends on what the guests want, but usually, the entire crew ends up having to work together to get all of the tasks done.</p><p>Because they want to make sure the guests have the best experience possible, the crew does everything humanly possible to fulfill their needs. But, sometimes, the preference sheet requests can be pretty challenging.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One charter requested almost a dozen-course meal.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>On Season 4 of Below Deck Sailing Yacht, <a href=#>Chef Illeisha Dell</a> was tasked with fulfilling a preference sheet request for a 10-course meal. Because there is only one chef onboard at a time, she alone had to create the concepts, cooking, and plating.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Then, the rest of the crew was in charge of serving all ten courses to the guests. This request definitely goes down as one of the most strenuous preference sheet tasks in the history of the series.</p><p>But, preference sheets do end up having their benefits in the long run.

Yet, all of the guests are usually not on the same page.</p><p>While half of the guests might want a fancy steak dinner, the other half could be strict vegetarians. These accommodations make it more difficult for the crew to make everyone happy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This dilemma doesn't just happen on Sailing Yacht, but also on the original Below Deck series. Chef Ben Robinson publicly aired out his frustration when it came to difficult preference sheets.</p><p>He said, "I’ve read a series of eight preference sheets, and not one of them would agree on one plate of food. And it’s kind of absurd." This back-and-forth can also be a frustrating experience for the guests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpb%2BmssSrnKeblWLAqbHErWSbnZykxG6wxJyiZquRnrmqusZmsJqbmKk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
