After that, the devil came for me. I went a bit doo-lally and got carried away by it all.”</p><p>He thought this would be the start of a bright new future for him but he admits he “stopped putting in the effort” and became lazy.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><p>He went from getting £50,000 as runner up at the World Championships in 2008 to living in a “flea-ridden one-bed flat” four years later.</p><p>Kirk said: “I went through a crazy phase because I had suddenly come into all this fame and I didn't know how to deal with it.</p><p>"I'd gone from nowhere to a big final, without reaching the last 16 or quarter-finals of other competitions along the way, and I had nothing to fall back on by way of experience.”</p><p>He was gambling and hitting the bottle and had no manager to straighten him out.</p><p>With the benefit of hindsight,&nbsp; he now admits that getting to the final was “too much, too soon”.</p><p>Kirk said: “In hindsight, reaching that final at Ally Pally was too much, too soon. It was my first-ever success at a major tournament and, in hindsight, I wasn't ready for it.”</p><p>As he was slipping down the rankings ‘dartitis’ struck – a mental block which prevents players from letting go of the arrows.</p><p>He handed his Tour card back two years ago and became a recluse.</p><p>Kirk said: “I don't know where it came from, but I haven't picked up a dart in about three years. I was just stood there on the oche one day, I went to throw a dart and my arm simply wouldn't go forward.</p><p>“I knew straight away what it was and I tried to play through it, but I went to a Pro Tour floor event in <a href=#>Barnsley</a> and got beat 6-0. I went home and told the missus, 'I'll never throw another dart again.'</p><p>"It was causing me a lot of stress and anxiety, this game I had been playing for 20 years, and all of a sudden it was giving me panic attacks.”</p><p>He didn’t leave the house for 18 months.</p><p>Fortunately, things are now looking up for him thanks to a lot of support from both the players union, the PDPA, and the PDC who sorted him out with counselling and he’s in a “much better place now”.</p><p>Kirk has been getting his life back together and has been qualifying as an electrician with the firm Bilfinger in Haydock.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He’s also the dad to three boys, aged 15, 13 and six and things are so much “brighter” now he is even considering picking the arrows once more.</p><p>Kirk said: “I might have left darts, but darts has never left me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kirk-shepherd-action-ladbrokes-com-4490242.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/englands-21-year-old-kirk-4357119.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91hZdwaGxrX5mus8DSZq6oqpyZeqS0wKanoqeeqLWqvIyfoKeZnJ7AtXnKoqmkZaOdsrG0xKubZpyinrusecaapJukmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
