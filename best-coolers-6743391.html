This spacious cooler has a generous 58-liter capacity. It can hold up to 39 cans with room to spare for plenty of ice. While it weighs 29 pounds when empty, the rope handles make it easy enough for two people to carry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What makes this Yeti cooler the best? Its heavy-duty plastic uses a rotomolding technique to ensure dependable durability while allowing it to be hollow — just like a high-grade whitewater kayak. It didn’t have any issues when shoved off a table during our testing, and the Yeti team also boasts the triumph this cooler had over a grizzly bear (so your goods won’t get stolen by a hungry bear if you go camping). The 65 Tundra closes securely, thanks to the T-shaped latches. Although the lid doesn't have built-in cup holders, this makes it all the more comfortable to sit on. You could even use the large surface as a small table for picnicking or playing cards.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After 24 hours, only about half the ice had melted, and the internal temperature increased just 0.2 degrees. Needless to say, our drinks were still cold. We think this is a great choice for camping, boating trips, or hosting barbecues. The price is really steep for a cooler, but it's backed by a five-year warranty and might be worth the investment. Plus, talk to any Yeti owner, and they'll assure you: If you're looking for a high-quality cooler, it doesn't get better than this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Yeti cooler just keeps getting better. It keeps ice intact better than any other cooler we’ve used (seriously, it will save you a fortune on ice). The materials are top-notch and show no signs of wear even after six months of testing at home. It’s definitely heavy, but that’s not a dealbreaker, and we think it’s great for tailgating, camping, boating, or any day spent in the great outdoors.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 30.5 x 17.5 x 16 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 29 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 58 liters | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyethylene, polyurethane foam</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-coleman-chiller-48-quart-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coleman Chiller Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Coleman Chiller 48-quart Insulated Portable Cooler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5Sj28n_rfgg4vdU8s8TUJPfHl0c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Coleman-Chiller-48-quart-Insulated-Portable-Cooler-8a03e20ae948413eb3db9416bad3d6b5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Great mid-size cooler that’s easy to carry around thanks to light weight and side handles</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Only half the ice had melted after 24 hours (which is decent for a cooler with basic functions)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>At least $100 less than every other top-rated cooler on our list</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On a budget? You can't go wrong with the Coleman Chiller. This classic cooler is a perfect mid-size option for tailgate parties and family get-togethers. While it doesn't have many bells and whistles, it certainly gets the job done. After filling it up and letting it sit for 24 hours, roughly half the ice had melted, and the temperature only went up 1.8 degrees.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note is that this Coleman cooler doesn't have latches. However, the lid shuts tightly and seems to have a good seal. The side handles make it easy for one or two people to carry, and despite the lightweight design, it works well as a seat, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite its low price, this cooler has shown a competitive performance against our pricier options over six months of home testing. We accidentally left it outside in the snow and rain and it didn’t fade or have any wear. We’ve used it to bring groceries home and store extra water bottles in our garage. It’s very versatile and the quality has definitely held up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 26 x 14.5 x 14 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 8.2 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 45.5 liters | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyethylene</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-the-beach-pelican-20-quart-elite-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for the Beach</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pelican 20 Quart Elite Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1116 data-sizes=750px alt="Pelican 20 Quart Elite Cooler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KTaFZQdOpZpUAzxFG_-70i_qWso=/fit-in/1500x1116/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ScreenShot2022-09-02at12.15.02PM-f121c97ea8554062b441d767b5aba683.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Can hold 26 12-ounce cans (more than advertised)</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Cooled down within minutes of adding ice</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Easy for one person to carry thanks to sturdy handles</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You'll be glad to have the Pelican Elite on hand next time you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>head to the beach</a>. Resembling an oversized, heavy-duty lunchbox, it has a 19-liter capacity. While it's on the smaller side for a cooler, it can hold 26 cans, or ten or so with ice, (enough to get a family through a day in the sun) and is easy for one person to carry. The latch closes without a fuss, and you can release it one-handed with the press of a button.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There's also a hidden bottle opener and four shallow can holders on the lid. This durable icebox cooled down within a couple minutes of being filled with ice. The Pelican Elite doesn't have a drain plug, but the small size makes emptying and cleaning it a breeze. It left our durability test with only minor scuffs and no significant damage. It's certainly not the most affordable option, but considering the lifetime warranty, we think it’s worth the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After testing in the lab, we kept assessing this cooler for a month at home. It quickly became a part of our tester’s weekly routine for storing various meal-prepped food on their commute to work —&nbsp;including an hour drive and 48-hour shift. This cooler has proven its toughness, and falls closely behind the Yeti in terms of keeping ice frozen. The interior is somewhat oddly shaped though, which can create a challenge for stacking items.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 19 x 18.5 x 14 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 19.5 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 19 liters | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyurethane, stainless steel<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-gatherings-orca-140-quart-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Large Gatherings</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Orca 140-Quart Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Orca 140 Quart Cooler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/TG4cRIshdoA-fMTTZGznhsVJrY8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/orca-140-quart-cooler-90dd66810a874ca884887d3f08361178.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Orcacoolers</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Backed by a lifetime guarantee</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Can fit nearly 200 cans and keeps drinks cold for multiple days</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Thermoplastic exterior had zero scratches after being pushed off a table</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=2><p>Still weighs 64 pounds even when empty, and it doesn't have wheels, which makes portability a challenge</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Expensive for some budgets</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re hosting a large gathering, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fire up your grill</a> and fill up the Orca 140 Quart Cooler. Boasting a generous 132.5-liter capacity, it can hold nearly 200 cans at once. Not only that, but after filling it up and waiting 24 hours, only about a quarter of the ice had melted, and the internal temp rose less than a degree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This oversized cooler weighs 64 pounds when empty and gets quite a bit heavier when filled with drinks and ice. Since it doesn't have wheels, you'll want to recruit a buddy before lifting or moving it. All that said, the thermoplastic exterior is certainly durable, sustaining exactly zero scratches when we pushed it off a ledge. And although Orca coolers are undoubtedly expensive, the brand backs them with a lifetime guarantee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested this cooler for six months at home, and found its capacity to be continually impressive. When we entertained, it kept any and all drinks cold, including tall wine bottles. The seal stays tight and the drinks stay cool for a long time. However, we do have to call attention to its 64 pound weight. This cooler works perfectly when set in one place, but don’t try to move it unless you’re ready for a big challenge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 39.5 x 23 x 21.5 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 64 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 132.5 liters | <strong>Material:</strong> Thermoplastic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-camping-ozark-trail-45-quart-high-performance-rolling-roto-molded-cooler-with-microban></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Camping</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ozark Trail High Performance Rolling Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ozark Trail 45 Quart High Performance Rolling Roto-Molded Cooler with Microban" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/REAlyZ0_MQGeFYFBnk2pyvMSv7w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ozark-trail-45-quart-high-performance-rolling-roto-molded-cooler-with-microban-70d1250439da4c8eac4d0f2cc2bfd0e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Heavy-duty rotomolded exterior only sustained minor scuffs after durability tests</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Durable wheels that aid portability</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Effective design that can hold several cases of beer and latches that close securely</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This rugged rotomolded option from Ozark Trail is ideal for camping. The durable design latches securely and has a tight seal. And while it took a little while to cool down, it does a good job maintaining a chilled temperature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a 42.5-liter capacity, it can easily hold a couple cases of beer or roughly 48 cans of your drink of choice. There are four cup holders and a handy fish ruler on the lid, which is great for long days on the lake. Best of all, the large, durable wheels make it easy to transport, even when full. It might be a little hard for a child or shorter adult to pull, but it rolled pretty effortlessly over paved paths and grassy areas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested this cooler for six months outside the lab to see its day-to-day performance, and it didn’t let us down. The seal is tight and doesn’t leak at all. We like the added feature of attached bottle openers, which came in handy on multiple occasions. Everything stays cool for hours inside, and it’s easy to roll around on various terrain —&nbsp;a bonus for those who like to camp and need a portable option. It is a little heavy to lift, but given its overall performance, we’ll forgive that. The handle and wheels are still in great condition after six months, and this has become frequently used for road trips and outdoor events in our household.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 26.5 x 19.5 x 18.5 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 28 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 42.5 liters | <strong>Material:</strong> Thermoplastic</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-tailgates-lifetime-65-quart-high-performance-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Tailgates</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lifetime High-Performance Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Lifetime 65-Quart High-Performance Hard Cooler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SHiorpNsdbSC3eY4-q9d6Hr_UNI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lifetime-65-quart-high-performance-hard-cooler-06284bb6c0124cd78cb49e623f489d7b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Cools effectively for upwards of 48 hours</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Large enough to comfortably sit on it; doubles as a seat for tailgates and events</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Highly durable when pushed off a counter; no scratches</p></li><li readability=0><p>Huge capacity, fit 26 more 12-ounce cans than manufacturer claimed would fit</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For tailgates and outdoor sporting events, you need a cooler that’s spacious, can double as a seat, and stays cool for a long time (especially when you’re outside all day). The Lifetime 65-quart High Performance Cooler satisfies all of those needs with a durable design that’s built to last.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It easily opens and closes, but still locks in the temperature —&nbsp;which only dropped by 0.8 degrees during the 24-hour period that we tested it (and 75 percent of the ice was still frozen). Our only major gripe is that it’s difficult to move — the rope handles aren’t the most sturdy to grip and with the heavy weight and lack of wheels, this cooler is tricky to move without two people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the plus side, the large lid creates a nice bench seat and this cooler holds 26 more cans than the manufacturer advertised. Plus, the hard material kept this cooler from opening or scratching when it was pushed off a table during testing. None of the ice water even spilled or leaked after impact.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We reported insights after one, three, and six months, and found this cooler to perform consistently with our initial lab assessment. The large cooler is great for all-day events, and so well-insulated it can stay cool for an entire weekend without needing to add more ice. It has held up to all sorts of weathering and is most commonly thrown in our car for weekend trips. It’s easy to clean and drains completely, so it’s ready to go the next time you need to use it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>17.5 x 18.1 x 28.4<strong> | Weight: </strong>25.5 pounds<strong> | Capacity: </strong>61.5 liters<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyethylene construction and stainless steel bottle opener</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-day-trips-the-get-out-cooler-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Day Trips</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Get Out Cooler Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Get Out Cooler Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hoha9zU8F2i5awntsflPZRz0-NQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TheGetOutCoolerBag-21daff9a4d934f47abdc6f86c234e8cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Get Out</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Retro-inspired design that’s durable enough to be pushed off a counter and still look amazing</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Insulated backpack is big enough for 12 cans and tall enough for wine bottles</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Drinks remained chilled inside the cooler after 24 hours</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For hikes, intimate picnics, outdoor concerts, and other day trips, we recommend The Get Out Cooler Bag. This backpack-style cooler has a retro Boy Scouts appeal, but that's not the only thing our team liked about it. Compact and lightweight yet surprisingly roomy, there's enough space to fit 12 cans, and it's even tall enough for wine bottles. The straps are also comfy and conveniently adjustable. There's an exterior pocket, but it's too flat to fit anything more than a paper map — we couldn't even jam a smartphone in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After 24 hours, about two-thirds of the ice had melted, but our cans were still plenty cold. And the sturdy soft-sided exterior didn't scratch or scuff when we dropped it. The Cooler Bag is priced pretty steep for its size, but we think it's a decent value. It would also make a great gift for a recreationist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 17 x 16 x 10 inches | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 15 liters | <strong>Material:</strong> Thermoplastic, polyurethane foam, nylon<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-soft-sided-yeti-hopper-m30-soft-cooler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Soft-Sided</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Yeti Hopper M30 Soft Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="YETI Hopper M30 Soft Cooler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pnRWPzqDS3bqXoMIaDiblM1dFuU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yeti-hopper-m30-soft-cooler-6c27f36e537046fb8a826b25f70e5ef8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Spacious enough for a 24-pack</p></li><li readability=0><p>Sturdy, water-repellent exterior that sustained no damage when we shoved it off a table</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Locks in the cold for upwards of 24 hours with layered insulation and a magnetic seal</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Yeti Hopper M30 is the best soft-sided cooler we tried. This cooler has a 27.5-liter capacity, which we thought was the perfect size for a 24-pack. It's got a super-sturdy textile exterior with a water-repellent coating that showed no signs of damage when we shoved it off a table.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Thanks to the magnetic seal, it didn't leak at all when knocked over either. While soft-sided coolers often don't work as well as their hard-sided counterparts, the Hopper M30 is another story. It chilled our drinks with ease, and a substantial amount of ice was left after 24 hours. The price might be hard to justify for a cooler of this size, but if you have the budget for it or find it on sale, we say go for it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even when we continued using this cooler for three months at home, it remained durable, versatile, and easy to use and maintain. It hasn’t had any wear or tear, and is easy to carry even when full. We like using this cooler to transport frozen groceries home from the store and store snacks during kids’ sporting events. It’s easy to wipe down and dries quickly, making this a functional, portable, and long-lasting cooler.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 25 x 17.5 x 12 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 7 pounds | <strong>Capacity:</strong> 27.5 liters | <strong>Material:</strong> Water-repellent textile, rubber foam<br></p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-10 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2798 data-sizes=750px alt="Yeti Hopper M30 Soft Cooler displayed on wood deck with white chair in background" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SsyaTJfkoZd-qP8ZFcN21sUsqE8=/fit-in/1500x2798/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_YetiHopperSoftSidedM30-DB_029.jpg-ed0523cb2adf4d5ba96513073ee7cd56.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4480 data-sizes=750px alt="Yeti Hopper M30 Soft Cooler sits on table outside" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/b9Wj6X5c36gTgh-Bx7NlhYRrNOk=/fit-in/1500x4480/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/coolers-test-yeti-hopper-soft-sided-m30-hwortock-665-23b38f05272943beb24d3859276709e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Henry Wortock</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-wheels-xspec-45-quart-towable-rotomolded-cooler-with-wheels></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Wheels</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>XSpec Towable Rotomolded Cooler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Xspec 45 Quart Towable Roto Molded Ice Chest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ssV97HQr2WzxKJrTWeuQq5Z3ZJc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/xspec-45-quart-towable-roto-molded-ice-chest-8d493ddf652444eaaea764920d1dbdd4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Insulation</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Portability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Heavy-duty wheels and an extendable tow handle make this deep ice chest easy to transport</p></li><li readability=1><p>Has a fish ruler, bottle opener, and leak-proof drain plug</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Sturdy and durable against impacts; passed our durability test</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>Even with the wheels, it's somewhat hard to move when packed full</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Doesn't have any cup holders</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Large coolers are heavy when empty, let alone filled with ice and drinks. But thanks to its large, heavy-duty wheels and extendable tow handle, this 35-pounder is surprisingly easy to move around. (Just bear in mind packing it full to the brim might make it a bit harder to pull.) It's incredibly sturdy, too, passing our drop test with flying colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Xspec Ice Chest has an extra-deep capacity that fits up to 40 cans, while a leak-proof drain plug makes emptying it a breeze. After 24 hours, most of the ice was still intact, and the temperature only went up 2 degrees. Although the lid doesn't have any cup holders, it has a fish ruler and a built-in bottle opener — and it makes a nice seat in a pinch. All things considered, we think the price is reasonable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The portability of this cooler has proven useful over the three months we tested it at home. We primarily used this cooler for tailgates and outdoor parties because it’s the perfect size to store enough drinks for a whole party while still being easy to move around. And in most cases, the ice lasted longer than the drinks (around four to five days in our experience). The latches and wheels are sturdy, and the chamber is spacious enough to hold 40 cans.

Then we swapped out a few cans for ice and lifted and carried the coolers around to gauge portability and how heaviness. For good measure, we even shoved the coolers off of tables to test durability.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To measure the cooler’s cooling abilities, we took the temperature right when we added ice and again two hours later and 24 hours later. We also measured the amount of ice at each check-in. We checked for leaks during this time (due to melting ice). We then drained and cleaned each cooler. For specialized models, we had a few sub-tests, too, such as maneuverability for wheeled coolers (moving and turning them around the lab), carrying coolers with straps to assess comfort, and sitting on large coolers to see if they can double as a seat for tailgates and such. Weighing all of these characteristics, we determined the best coolers of 2024. After identifying our favorites, we tested the coolers at home for six months to see how they held up in real-life scenarios, and we have updated this piece with those findings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Henry Wortock</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-a-cooler></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying a Cooler</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most important things to consider when buying a cooler is the size, including the overall dimensions and capacity. Mid-size coolers measure roughly 25 x 15 x 14 inches on average, with capacities ranging from 30 to 50 liters (which comes out to about 35 to 55 cans, plus ice).

A textile exterior can also hold up better in terms of scratch resistance.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Portability<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, you'll want to consider portability.

If you're hoping to get a newer model in a specific color, you might want to shop around in the late winter or early spring. However, if you're hoping to buy one on sale, start your search in the fall or early winter.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-22e4b28a-c024-4b96-9bb4-4f48797f8c58></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.382171226831><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long do coolers keep food and drinks cold?</span></p><p>It depends on the size and insulation, but when filled with ice, most coolers will keep food and drinks cold for at least a day, sometimes longer. The models we selected for this roundup still had a substantial amount of unmelted ice after 24 hours and kept our drinks cold the entire time.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.95424836601307><p><span class=accordion__title>How much ice should you add to a cooler?</span></p><p>A good rule of thumb is a two-to-one (2:1) ratio of ice to drinks. This means you'll want to add twice as much ice as cans and bottles. Since ice cubes take up more space than larger slabs of solid ice, you can maximize space with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">freezer blocks</a> or pre-frozen food.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>When should you replace a cooler?</span></p><p>Most coolers last anywhere from five to 10 years. Investing in a high-quality model might be a wise idea, as many are backed by warranties ranging from five years to lifetime guarantees.</p><p>Generally speaking, if it closes securely and doesn't have any cracks or holes, the insulation should continue to work. However, if there's substantial damage, a lingering odor, or your cooler simply doesn't work as well as it used to, then it's time to get a new one.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Theresa Holland</a> is a commerce writer and product reviewer specializing in lifestyle, travel, and recreation. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Madison Yauger</a> is a staff senior commerce writer for PEOPLE who’s tested hundreds of lifestyle products across all categories.
