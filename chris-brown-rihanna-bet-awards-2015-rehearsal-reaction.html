It&nbsp;made him a bit nervous and that’s why he didn’t do much press. He&nbsp;didn’t want to be bombarded with questions about either of them. His&nbsp;mind was solely focused on his performances and he didn’t want&nbsp;anything distracting him from that,” our source tells us. “But when Ri came and to see part of his rehearsal, he was like what?&nbsp;Is this really happening? He played it cool, told her she looked&nbsp;beautiful as always and was surprised and humbled by her words. That&nbsp;made his day, truthfully, and he’s very appreciative of that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>[jwplatform wxf7UD0P]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The best part was during the actual performance she was seen dancing and singing along, meanwhile Karrueche Tran totally avoided him at the show! Our insider actually told us that Rihanna is happy Kae and Chris split up: “Karrueche doesn’t cut it. Chris needs someone who’s equally yoked. He needs someone that will challenge him mentally. He needs someone to understand him for who is is and never, ever judge him. He’s completely fragile and that’s all right. He’s got a soft side of him that only few people see. He needs that all around woman that’s going to love him, honor him and&nbsp;at the same time call him out on his shit to make him a better man. He might not be ready for that just yet – but that’s exactly what he needs. And he knows it.”</p><h3></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Chris and Rihanna will ever get back together?</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>— Reporting by Eric Mitchell, Written by Chloe Melas</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH13e5JpZpygop7Abq7RqK6nZaKetaK6zZpkm52kYq64rdGdqmZqYGaCbr7EoZyaqqOWuW6%2BxJqaraGfo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
