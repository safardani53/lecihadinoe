If it attacks someone or causes fear in our communities, you are the one held responsible, you are the one facing prosecution, but your dog could also face being euthanised. If you know your dog can escape your garden, fix it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"Build higher fences, put a lock on the gate, put up signage for people to be aware, and not enter.

Dogs think like dogs and it’s dangerous to apply human thinking to a dog’s behaviour.</p><p>“The same goes within your own home; teach your children from a young age to respect dogs, don’t let them climb or jump on them, ensure your dog has somewhere quiet to go that is their space, away from family life. Sometimes simple common-sense, low-cost changes can make the difference.”</p><p>The dog in the footage was seized by officers, but later returned to the owner with conditions and guidance to follow.</p><p>The owner of the dog is being processed through restorative justice for the harm caused to the victims.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4FygpNtbmpnnaS6prrTZqSupV2lv7DAxJyrrGWSlq%2B6edOeqauhlq62r7OMnaagZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
