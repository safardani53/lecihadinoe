Likewise, his father, Soterios, was an aerospace engineer for the Department of Defense and co-owner of a deli.</p><p>At the same time, his mother, Georgia, used to work as a beautician at a local salon.</p><p>Additionally, his father was born Greek, and his mother was Polish Jewish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/a-champions-mind-lessons-from-a-life-in-tennis-pete-sampras-first-edition-signed-rare.webp><p>Likewise, Pete is their third child among four, and all of them spent their first year in Potomac, Maryland. Later, they moved to Ranchi Palos Verdes, California.</p><p>Accordingly, moving to the California climate, all four got interested in Tennis and joined the Peninsula Racquet Club. And reportedly, Pete joined Palos Verdes High School.</p><h2>Pete Sampras | Career</h2><h3>Tennis and Peter Fischer</h3><p>Firstly, Pete’s parents noticed him playing with a tennis racket hitting the ball against the wall.</p><p>Then, he participated in local D.C. high school courts that upgraded him quickly to the game.</p><p>Eventually, his lifetime first coach became<strong> Peter Fischer</strong>, a pediatrician, and tennis buff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Peter-Fischer.jpg><p>Though Fischer was not a professional and experienced coach, Fischer could teach their son strategy for parents.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fischer was the one who shifted Sampras from being a baseline player to a <strong>serve and volley player.</strong> Also, he improved Sampras’s monster serve.</p><p>Despite being a non-professional coach, Fisher got lots of patience to teach his only student to deal with his emotions.</p><p>In fact, Sampras used to get offended after losing a match. While Fischer reminded him to raise the bar of expectation, his real competitor was legendary Australian tennis player <a href=#>Rod Laver</a>.</p><p>Rod Laver was a lifelong role model of Fischer himself.</p><h3>Tour</h3><p>Continuously showing interest in Tennis made Sampras away from socialization. He had no close friends from all of his teenage days and never played any other sports except where he practiced.</p><p>Later in 1987, Sampras joined the Unites States Tennis Association (USTA) Boys’ 18 tournaments. There he ranked second in singles and first in doubles.</p><p>Further, Sampras won <strong>$7,000</strong> in prize money, ranking <strong>No.311</strong> worldwide.</p><p>Hence, from there, he became a professional. Similarly, Sampras entered a grand slam event, the U.S. Open in <strong>1989 U.S. Open</strong> where he made it into the fourth round.</p><p>Afterward, Sampras had an issue with Fisher, so they departed from each other.</p><p>According to Fischer, Sampras was not training enough but expected to rank Number 1.</p><p>Other than that, no position was unacceptable for Sampras.</p><p>Nevertheless, departing after so long, Sampras had long praised Fischer, who made him a champion rather than a good tennis player.</p><h2>Pete Sampras | Grand Slam Cup</h2><p>In the same way, in 1990, Sampras ranked in the fourth round of the Australian Open.</p><p>He earned his first-ever professional victory at the U.S. Pro Indoors in Philadelphia. Indeed, players used to have their first service over the top of speed.</p><p>But surprisingly, Sampras’s second serve also met the speed of his first one.</p><p>With all of his speedy strength, Sampras beat <a href=# rel=noopener>Ivan Lendl</a>&nbsp;in five sets in the quarterfinals.</p><p>He became a four-time Open winner in the semifinals and competed with Andre Agassi in the finals. Truly, Samprass won over in three sets by 6-4, 6-3, and 6-2.</p><p>Then, just at the age of 19 years, 28 days, Sampras recorded becoming the youngest U.S. Open winner in history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sddefault.jpg><p>After the grand surprise of strength in Sampras, many grabbed their attention on him.</p><p>In addition, he once said that he was not prepared and unknown for something that grand to happen.</p><p>As everyone around him suddenly expects more and the best from him, that shyness and immaturity inside him got into a problem.</p><p>Subsequently introducing sudden changes in his physical appearance, Sampras has physical injuries too.</p><p>Accordingly, he skipped the Australian Open but was eliminated from the second Wimbledon and French Open rounds.</p><p><strong>You might also be interested in <a href=#>Alexander Nubel Bio: Career, Stats, Clubs, Contract & Transfer >></a></strong></p><h3>Wimbledon</h3><p>Later in 1992, Sampras got his new coach, Tom Gullikson, a former top-ten player.</p><p>Moreover, Gullikson was the one who made Sampras depend less on his serve and strokes, and strategy.</p><p>In the same year, he reached to semifinals at Wimbledon with his hard-serving powerhouse.</p><p>That year, Sampras might have lost Grand Slam but got millions of dollars as prize money and <strong>70 match wins</strong>.</p><p>Further, in 1993, he stopped in the quarterfinals at French Open. On the other side, Wimbledon defeated Agassi in the quarterfinals, Boris Becker in the semifinals, and Courier.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, Sampras earned his first Wimbledon championship, including the second U.S. Open, scoring against Cedric Pioline.</p><p>As much as the excitement seems, the media posted hundreds of news about Sampras.</p><p>Furthermore, he was a simple, humble, polite, and professional player, but brand endorsements and unwanted ads were hampering him alongside.</p><p>Distracting news making him on and off the court disturbed him, but he was also training to focus on winning alone.</p><p>In 1994, Sampras went straight to his third <strong>Grand Slam</strong> title, winning the first <strong>Australian Open championship</strong>.</p><p>Likewise, again defeating Ivanisevic, Sampras handed in his second title on the grass court.</p><p>Later, he got an ankle injury making him take serious bed rest for about six weeks, hindering his best performance at the U.S Open. Still, Sampras was ranked to be No.1.</p><h2>Pete Sampras | Awards and Achievements</h2><h3>Records</h3><p>Starting from being the highest number of year-end finishes as World rank 1:6, Sampras’ most consecutive years ended as World No. 1:6.</p><p>Namely, he had the best winning percentage at Wimbledon in the Open Era with 90%.</p><p>As mentioned above, Sampras is the youngest to win the U.S. Open championship in the Open Era.</p><p>Moreover, Sampras is one of the only four players in the Open Era to have a Grand Slam in 4 years.</p><h3>Awards and Accomplishments</h3><table><tbody readability=4><tr readability=2><td width=176><strong>Year</strong></td><td width=378><strong>Awards and Accomplishments</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=176><strong>1990</strong></td><td width=378>U.S. Open; Grand Slam Cup</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=176><strong>1991</strong></td><td width=378>American Tennis Pro (ATP) World Championships</td></tr><tr><td width=176><strong>1993</strong></td><td width=378>U.S. Open</td></tr><tr><td width=176><strong>1993-95</strong></td><td width=378>Wimbledon</td></tr><tr><td width=176><strong>1994-1997</strong></td><td width=378>Australian Open</td></tr><tr><td width=176><strong>1995-96</strong></td><td width=378>U.S. Open</td></tr><tr><td width=176><strong>1997-2000</strong></td><td width=378>Wimbledon</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=176><strong>2002</strong></td><td width=378>U.S. Open (Final match before retirement)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Pete Sampras | Tragedy</h2><p>Besides having a world recording strength, Sampras has true relation and polite relationship with his recent coach.</p><p>Similarly, in 1995, while at the Australian Open, he learned that Gullikson, his coach and friend, had Brain Cancer.</p><p>While in the match, a random fan called Pete to win the match for his coach, which immediately broke Sampras down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pete-got-emtional-for-his-caoch-Gullikson.jpg><p>In brief, he also had sobbed on the court, remembering such things outbursting his emotions.&nbsp;</p><p>But after losing the complete first round in <strong>French Open</strong>, he again wins his third most Wimbledon championship.</p><p>In the same year, Sampras received his third career U.S. Open title, ranking No.1 on the list.</p><p><strong>Also, read About <a href=#>Jessie Moses Bio: Early Life, Ethnicity, Kids & Husband >></a></strong></p><h3>Married Life</h3><p>Relating to his personal life, Sampras married<strong> Bridgette Wilson</strong>, former <strong>Miss Teen USA</strong>, on 30th September 2000.</p><p>The couple also has two children.
