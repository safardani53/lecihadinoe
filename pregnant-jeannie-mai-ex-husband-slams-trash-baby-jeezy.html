I upgraded from trash to treasure a long time ago. Best decision I ever made. Congratulations. Being truly happy is an amazing feeling. Love my little family.” he wrote.</p><p>The comments have since been deleted.</p><p>On Thursday, Jeannie's co-host <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Loni Love responded</a> to Freddy's comments on Instagram.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>"Auntie Loni here: This sounds like a woman answering… @thehollywoodhunter you better then this ..</p><p>"We were happy with your children being born so show the same grace to Baby Jenkins," she added.</p><p>Freddy's partner Linsey Toole also chimed in on the drama, as she responded to a user who said, "Lol you might as well deactivate your page cause they gone tear you up in the comments,"</p><p>Linsey wrote back: "I truly don't want to put her through what she put me through when I was pregnant. Stop the drama and let us all live."</p><p>Jeannie <a href=#>announced her big news</a> earlier this week on The Real, revealing that she'd hidden the pregnancy for five months.</p><h2>BIG ANNOUNCEMENT</h2><p>"I can definitely say that <a href=#>our&nbsp;Real&nbsp;fam is growing</a>, and it's been really hard to keep all of these secrets for you guys because we've had so much to reveal here at the show, including the fact that I am pregnant!," Jeannie shared as she sprang up from her seat caressing her baby bump.</p><p>Jeannie also talked about her <a href=#>husband</a> in the clip, admitting through tears how her life has changed since connecting with the rapper.</p><p>"Jeezy made me realize that I never really felt safe in my life, ya know? I've never really truly felt safe.</p><p>"Falling in love with Jeezy, meeting someone who also didn't really feel safe in their life, we began to create a place where our happiness spelled out what safe looked like around us," she said.</p><p>Jeannie shared the clip on her Instagram as well as photos from a maternity shoot she took with Women's Health.</p><h2><strong>THE JOURNEY</strong></h2><p>The television host spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Women's Health</a>&nbsp;about the couple's&nbsp;<a href=#>process of getting pregnant</a>, after trying for "over a year" and then resorting to IVF due to her age and health complications.</p><p>The former makeup artist told the outlet: "Jeezy and I have been kind of saving this and hiding this for five months. So, we’re relieved to finally share the news."</p><p>Jeannie continued: "It was not easy. We both needed a bit of assistance, especially with me being 41 at the time."</p><p>Just one month before the&nbsp;<a href=#>Dancing With The Stars alum said "I do,"</a>&nbsp;the couple found out they were pregnant.</p><h2>MISCARRIAGE HEARTACHE</h2><p>However, shortly after, the performer suffered a devastating miscarriage.</p><p>"I wondered if I was being punished," she recalled, explaining that prior to her new relationship she had never wanted to be a parent.</p><p>"I wondered if I’d jinxed myself or cursed myself. My entire life, I never wanted children. When I say never, I’m talking a hard-stop never."</p><p>After her miscarriage, she reconsidered her viewpoint on expanding the family as she felt she found a "safe" environment with her now-hubby.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Falling in love with Jeezy made me see life differently for myself. Our love is honest, pure, and safe…something I hadn’t felt as a child," she confessed.</p><p>Jeannie and Jeezy started dating in 2019 and got married in April.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681928445.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000681349481-1.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>The Real's pregnant Jeannie Mai Jenkins breaks down in tears gushing about husband Jeezy & showing off baby bump on show</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZ2d%2BeYKRaKernZejrq%2FAjKOcmqaenrJuucCiZJ6wXZ3CtK7Ap5tmq5yWurR506uYrKBdl66jxYyjnJ6yqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
