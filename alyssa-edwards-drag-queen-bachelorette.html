Alyssa boasts 1.4 million followers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a> and has partnerships with brands like Smirnoff and TAZO.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a>, the entertainer credited her gay uncle for recognizing her talent from an early age. "He was just like, 'He's gifted. We need to get him involved in dance, because he picks up this stuff really quickly,'" Alyssa recalled.</p><p>"I would stay after and watch the other classes, and I would kind of do the choreography on the side.

That's kind of where it all began."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alyssa has a controversial history with pageants.</h2><p>Nearly a decade ago, the Texas resident was stripped of her 2010 Miss Gay America title for business dealings that conflicted with her obligations to the organization.

Under the dress, and behind the door of my home and the walls of the studio. My family life."</p><p>Justin said it’s important to note that Dancing Queen is a docuseries, not a produced reality show like RDR. "What you see is what was really going on," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EW</a>. "I just said, 'Look, I’m going to be myself. I’m going to show up, I’m going to do what I do, and I’m going to allow you guys to stand in the corner, but you have to stay far back because it can get action-packed!'"</p><p>Catch Alyssa on The Bachelorette tonight, May 20, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrm6v9KaZJ6cp5a%2Fpb%2BMnaman12mwqaxzWaZmpuYmrmwvsStq54%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
