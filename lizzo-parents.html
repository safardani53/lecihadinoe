It probably won’t come as a huge surprise to you that she wasn’t known as Lizzo at the time — her given name is Melissa Viviane Jefferson. At the age of 10, Lizzo and her family moved to Houston, Tex., where she began rapping when she was a teenager. She got the nickname Lizzo when she was 14, and started studying classical music (<a href=#>with a focus on the flute</a>) at the University of Houston shortly thereafter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sadly, tragedy struck Lizzo’s life when her father died in 2009. In a 2019 interview with CBS This Morning, Lizzo said that her dad had always encouraged her to play music. Shortly after his death, she dropped out of school. “I was depressed. I didn't have a purpose. Like, I didn't feel like I had a purpose for being a musician or anything.”</p><p>“So that turned into, 'Oh can I sleep on your couch,' and that eventually, I got really guilt-ridden. So all I had was this car. It was a Subaru," she said. "That was my home for a little. I spent Thanksgiving in that car, and I remember I cried myself to sleep.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Fortunately, Lizzo was able to enjoy happier days. “I used everything that happened to me and made myself stronger,” she said. She joined a band after answering a Craigslist ad, moved to Minneapolis, and spent the next 10 years grinding and trying to make it in the music industry. And, obviously, it worked.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On New Year’s Eve 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lizzo tweeted</u></a> about the journey she’d been on over the past decade. “2009 was the year my daddy died. 2009 was the year I lived in my car & cried myself to sleep on Thanksgiving. 2019 is the year my album and song went No. 1. 2019 is the year I told my mama I can buy her a house. Anything can happen in a decade. Tomorrow is the beginning of [your] anything,” the tweet read.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Speaking of Lizzo’s mom, it turns out that 2020 had some good things in store for her, too. Lizzo posted on Dec. 20, 2020 that she had been able to gift her mom — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shari Johnson-Jefferson</a> — with a brand-new car for Christmas.</p><p>“Got my mommy a brand new Audi for Xmas,” Lizzo wrote in an Instagram caption beneath a video of the incredible surprise. “I remember crying in my car when my daddy passed, no job no money nowhere to live, wishing I could one day provide for my family. I couldn’t do it for my dad so ima make sure I spoil Mama. Happy holidays y’all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoba7xs5mp5qqlaPBtA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
