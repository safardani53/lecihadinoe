In honor of <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kim Kardashian</a> </strong>and <strong>Kanye “Ye” West</strong>’s son’s third birthday, Psalm was gifted a necklace featuring a string of emeralds and a giant “P” shaped pendant. Kim, 41, shared the photo of the bling on her Instagram Story on May 9, Psalm’s official birthday. The jewelry matched the theme of the Incredible Hulk-themed birthday party that Kim threw her baby boy. “PERIODDDDDDDD!!!!!” Kim captioned a second photo she posted to her Story, captured here by The Shade Room.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kim threw a smashing good party for her baby, decking out her California home in the shade of the green behemoth. There were Hulk-green balloons, a Hulk-green pinata (in the shape of the number 3), Hulk-themed treats, Hulk-themed games, plenty of Hulk fists to go around, and a giant statue of Jade Jaws himself. Kim also shared <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of a wall of Hulk hands with “PSALM” spelled out in large green letters.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>All that was missing was a cameo from <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mark Ruffalo</a>&nbsp;</strong>himself. Thankfully, Psalm’s siblings — &nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>North</strong></a>,&nbsp;8,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Saint</strong></a>, 6, and&nbsp;4-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chicago</strong></a> – were there to help Psalm celebrate. So were his cousins&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Penelope Disick</strong></a>, 9,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dream Kardashian</strong></a>, 5, and&nbsp;4-year-old <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>True Thompson</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kim-kardashian-shows-off-psalms-emerald-necklace-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>There was no sign of Kanye, 44, in the social media posts. Ye famously clashed with Kim over Chi’s fourth birthday party in January. “Y’all, I’m just wishing my daughter a public happy birthday,” he said in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video posted</a> on Jan. 15. “I wasn’t allowed to know where her party was. It’s nothing legal. These are the kind of games being played. This is the kind of thing that has affected my health for the longest, and I’m just not playing.” Ye eventually <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>showed up to the bash</a>, but he later thanked <strong>Travis Scott </strong>for “sending me the address and the time and making sure that I was able to spend that birthday memory with my daughter to be there with the rest of the family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“It’s just a matter of having a conversation, open dialogue, and everyone had a great time,” Ye said, adding that <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>&nbsp;allowed him into the party after “security” stopped him. “I’m really happy that I could be there for my children.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BpZqmrkaG6bsPErKtmppWYuK2twp5km6GiqbWlrdhmoqKlXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5ivam706hm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
