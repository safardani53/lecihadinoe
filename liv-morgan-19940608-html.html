In 2014, Daddio signed a contract with WWE and was assigned to the WWE Performance Center, later appearing in NXT under the Liv Morgan name. She was promoted to the main roster in 2017 and was paired with Ruby Riott and Sarah Logan to form the stable The Riott Squad. After the stable disbanded in 2019, Morgan became a singles competitor. After a few months of her singles run, she reunited with the returning Riott, who had been out of action for months with a shoulder injury, to reform the Riott Squad, now as a duo rather than a trio due to the release of Logan. Morgan and Riott performed together until Riott's release in 2021.</p><table class=wikibox readability=5><tr><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Gionna Jene Daddio</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>June 8, 1994, Morristown, New Jersey, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Ring name(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Gionna Daddio, Liv Morgan, Marley</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Billed from</td><td class=wk_value>Elmwood Park, New Jersey</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Trained by</td><td class=wk_value>WWE Performance Center</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Debut</td><td class=wk_value>June 27, 2015</td></tr></table><p>Wrestler Liv Morgan, byname of Gionna Jene Daddio was born on June 8, 1994 in Paramus, New Jersey, United States (She's 29 years old now).</p><p>Professional wrestler who debuted as a planted fan in WWE's NXT training program in 2014.
