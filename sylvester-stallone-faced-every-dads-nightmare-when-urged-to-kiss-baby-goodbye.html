Her father, Sylvester Stallone, recalls the emotional moment one of his children was diagnosed with a hole in their heart.</strong></p><p>Fans of the popular actor have been tuning in to see The Family Stallone, which shines a light into his family life, including his relationship with his five children. One of his daughters, Sophia Stallone, has a hole in her heart.</p><p>When Sophia underwent heart surgery, <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a> was urged to “kiss his baby goodbye.” He became teary when recalling the “nightmare” moment with his daughter, who said she “kept it together” for her parents.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/06/GettyImages-1433244119-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sophia-stallone-had-heart-surgery>Sophia Stallone had heart surgery</h2><p>Sylvester Stallone’s child Sophia underwent heart surgery at two months old. Doctors had diagnosed Sophia with a hole in her heart at two months, which led to her father “breaking down” as well as “everyone around her.”</p><p>She said, “I felt like I had to hold it together. I didn’t cry or worry about my heart surgery until the actual day when everyone left the room and I was alone, and then I felt like I could break down. I felt like, if I lose it, we’d all fall.”</p><p>Although the&nbsp;original procedure&nbsp;went well,&nbsp;Sophia Rose Stallone had to go back at age 16 due to a&nbsp;heart&nbsp;valve problem in 2012. She has had multiple heart surgeries, but 12 doctors initially had no idea what was wrong with her.</p><p>However, through “determination”, Sophia’s mom,&nbsp;Jennifer&nbsp;Flavin, finally “found a doctor that found the hole”. She lived her life normally until she was 16, and fainted while playing volleyball, before needing to have another operation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sylvester-recalls-nightmare-moment>Sylvester recalls ‘nightmare’ moment</h2><p>Sylvester <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recalled</a> Sophia’s first operation at two months. He said it was “such a nightmare,” and remembered the nurse holding his daughter and telling him: “Okay, kiss your baby goodbye.” Sylvester told the nurse, “Stop.”</p><p>He then claims he asked her to rephrase the sentence, and said: “This can’t be happening.” During a daddy-daughter date at a museum, Sophia said she feels PTSD from when she was 16 and got her second operation.</p><p>Sylvester agreed it was “devastating”. In a confessional, he added that it was “horrible.” He explained that Sophia was so “brave” and that they were all “falling apart” but she put on a “brave face,” while he was “scared to death.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/06/GettyImages-1182597901-1024x682.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sophia-has-yearly-heart-check-ups>Sophia has yearly heart check-ups</h2><p>Sophia now has to attend annual heart check-up appointments to ensure her heart is doing okay, which involves having a cardio consultation. Sylvester said that the family feels a “weight on their hearts” when she has the check-up.</p><p>They hope she won’t be told she’ll need another surgery. “That would be… devastating is too gentle of a word,” he said. Sophia went to her annual check-up and was told the patch over the hole in her heart is still in place.</p><p>“You’re great — your heart’s great,” Sophia’s doctor of 26 years told her, which was a huge relief for her and her entire family. “There’s no greater feeling,” her mom Jennifer responded to the news.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE FAMILY STALLONE ON PARAMOUNT PLUS EVERY WEDNESDAY</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqsCiedGemKWhpK56tcKOrLClrpWowaa%2BjKyrmqScpLumecWamp6cXZrDpr7YZpuanKNiu6qzx62kmqqVYsSpsc1mrKuflZl6tbuMpKCsq12XrqPFjKCmqJySrrI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
