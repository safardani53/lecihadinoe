Officers had to use a taser so there was minor use of force that occurred.”</p><p>The couple met in 2017 and <a href=#>welcomed their daughter in April</a> of the following year. Ariana’s parents have since broken up and reunited multiple times. After their most recent September breakup, the New York native told Us exclusively that he and the model were working things out.</p><p>“You know, we’re still not perfect, but <a href=#>we’re still working on our relationship every day</a>,” Ortiz-Magro said at the time. “I really think it is [about] being the best parents that we can be to Ariana and that we’re doing a great job so far.”</p><p>In February, the Famously Single alum gushed about his daughter and admitted she was the driving force behind his decision to <a href=#>enter rehab for alcohol abuse and depression</a>.</p><p>“If I’m not taking care of myself, I can’t take care of my daughter. I can’t take care of my family. That’s something that I’ve always thrived off of,” he told Us exclusively following his month of treatment at HeadWaters at Origins. “That little girl is like my guardian angel. I say to this day, <a href=#>she saved my life</a>. I think, without her, I don’t think I would’ve taken this step, because what would I have to lose?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ortiz-Magro added, “I’m a father. I’m a role model. I have to remember that. She’s getting older. She’s not getting younger. She’s getting older, and she’s getting smarter and smarter.”</p><p>With reporting by Taylor Ferber</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarp56jtqZ5zqurorJdoq6ovs5mqpqhlGK1pnnWmqWtq12ivLOxjKSgnatdnby2vtJmmZ6en6eybq3Rq5ysrF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
