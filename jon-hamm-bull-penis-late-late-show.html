My mom is in the audience, and she only came because she wants to find out how big the ‘Hammaconda’ is.” Hamm threw the bull penis chunks in his mouth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Jon Hamm Reveals Both of Jeremy Renner’s Arms ‘Snapped Like a Matchstick’ While Filming ‘Tag’</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First up in the game was Corden, who was forced with eating a tarantula if he did not answer, “Who is your least favorite guest that you’ve ever had on the couch?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There’s just no way that I can say that,” Corden replied. “Because he’s very famous.” After struggling with his choice, Corden downed the tarantula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That sounded kind of like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>potato chip</a>,” Hamm said, reacting to the crunch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next came Hamm, who had to down a chili cheese dog smoothie or answer, “You have recently expressed an interest in playing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Batman</a>. Rank these previous Batmans from best to worst: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>George Clooney</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Christian Bale</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Ben Affleck</a>.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hamm drank the smoothie. “I feel like that was one dog’s worth,” Hamm said afterward, describing the concoction as “thick.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hamm then threatened Corden with drinking bird saliva or naming his least favorite of Hamm’s movies. “This is easy because there are so many,” Hamm joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Corden skipped the saliva dish by responding with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tag</a>. “Fair enough,” Hamm answered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the fourth round, Hamm drank hot sauce instead of saying which of his former costars he would never want to work with again. After Hamm called the experience “eye-opening,” Corden quipped, “I don’t think your eyes are the only thing that’s gonna open.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Corden’s final question, he was faced with consuming bars of cow blood and pork tongue jelly or ranking his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fellow late-night hosts</a> (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Stephen Colbert</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jimmy Fallon</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Jimmy Kimmel</a>) from best to worst. Saying that all three had been kind to him, Corden sank his teeth into the jelly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0mihqKZdna6uuYybrKWkXaWyr7XSZqOarJViuaLAxGaqoaenZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
