Jenny found success faster than her cousin and helped Melissa score her first acting job.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While starring in MTV’s sketch series,&nbsp;The Jenny McCarthy Show,&nbsp;Jenny helped Melissa land a small appearance. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Jenny McCarthy Defends Her Cousin</h2><p>Although they do not make public appearances together, they seem to have each other’s backs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jenny has often defended her cousin from irrational attacks from the media, which was evident in 2013.</p><p>At the time, film critic Rex Reed called Melissa “tractor sized,” and demeaned her career, saying she was a “gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success.”</p><p>Reed had written a film review for the New York Observer for&nbsp;Identity Thief,&nbsp;which starred Melissa and&nbsp;Ozark’s&nbsp;lead, Jason Bateman. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In response, Jenny called out Reed in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">E! News</a> interview. “I don’t have the whole story, but I know that, after being in this business 20 years, it’s really crummy that you get attacked in your personal life. For anyone to attack like that, it’s just wrong and hurtful,” said the actress.&nbsp;</p><p>Another time she defended her cousin was when there were reports she had criticized her cousin for her weight in the past. She <a href=# rel="follow noopener">denied the rumors</a> and gushed about Melissa and her success.&nbsp;</p><p>The two McCarthys definitely share a sisterly bond as cousins. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKVo7u6ecycmpqqpJ3Gbr%2FIrKueql6dwa64</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
