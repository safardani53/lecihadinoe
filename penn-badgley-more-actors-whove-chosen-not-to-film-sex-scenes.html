Fidelity in every relationship, and especially my marriage, is really important to me.”</p><p>At the time, the actor explained that <a href=#>he thought about cutting back on intimacy scenes as soon as he accepted</a> the role of Joe Goldberg. (You debuted in 2018.)</p><p>“It just got to a point where I don’t want to do that. Before I took the show, it was a question, ‘Do I have a career if I don’t?’ Think about every male lead you’ve loved. Are they kissing someone? Are they doing a lot more than that?” Badgley, <a href=#>who welcomed a son with his wife in September 2020</a>, continued. “I said to Sera, ‘My desire would be zero, to go from 100 to zero.’ But I signed this contract, I signed up for this show, I know what I did. You can’t take this aspect out of the DNA of the concept, so ‘How much less can you make it?’ was my question for them.”</p><p>The Easy A actor credited You‘s showrunner <a href=#>for allowing him the freedom to veto future sex scenes</a>, saying, “She didn’t even bat an eye. She was really glad that I was that honest, and she had a really positive response. She appreciated my directness, and she appreciated that I was being reasonable and practical. And they came back with a phenomenal reduction.”</p><p>Meanwhile, McDonough <a href=#>claimed his stance on not kissing costars cost him a role</a> on ABC’s Scoundrels.</p><p>“I was [surprised], and it was a horrible situation for me,” the 100 alum recalled to Closer in 2019 about <a href=#>his decision not to film steamy scenes</a> with <strong>Virginia Madsen</strong>. “After that, I couldn’t get a job because everybody thought I was this religious zealot. I am very religious. I put God and family first, and me second. That’s what I live by. It was hard for a few years. But I was not going to lose the fight. And it worked. My career has been phenomenal.”</p><p>The Massachusetts native, who is a devout Catholic, also praised the way <a href=#>Desperate Housewives</a> accommodated his request. (McDonough played <a href=#><strong>Nicollette Sheridan</strong></a>’s husband on the hit drama from 2008 to 2009.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When [creator] <strong>Marc Cherry</strong> signed me, I said, ‘I’m sure you know, but I won’t kiss anybody,’” the <a href=#>Yellowstone</a> star, <a href=#>who has been married to modal <strong>Ruvé Robertson</strong> since 2003</a>, continued. “He was like, ‘But this is Desperate Housewives!’ I said, ‘I know.’ He paused for about five seconds and said, ‘All right, I’m just going to have to write better.’ And we had a great time.”</p><p>Scroll down for other stars who have publicly opted out of filming sex scenes:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Blsq%2B6jJuYnZ%2BcmsZuuc6rnGaZk6m8s7%2BMsJ%2BorpVisKm70p6lZqafqXq1u4yfoKWlXaiyuXnSnJynnaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
