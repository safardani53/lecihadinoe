After an altercation at a karaoke club, the 29-year-old was charged with disorderly behavior and harassment. Following the payment of a $500 bond, the actor was freed from detention. Representatives for The Flash and Warner Bros. have yet to comment on the matter.</p><h2>The reason behind Ezra Miller’s arrest</h2><p>According to the Hawaii County Police Department, officers from South Hilo responded to a report of a rowdy bar patron around 11:30 p.m. on March 27. Miller allegedly grew belligerent as other guests began singing karaoke and shouted obscenities. The Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them star then seized the microphone from a 23-year-old lady singing karaoke and rushed at a 32-year-old guy playing darts. Miller’s arrest comes at an inconvenient moment for Warner Bros. since the actor is due to participate in the studio’s forthcoming film, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore. The film is set to be released on April 15, 2022.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ezra-Miller-3.jpg alt="Ezra Miller" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Ezra Miller’s legal history</h2><p>Ezra Miller was a passenger in a car that was pulled over in 2011 for a broken brake light.
