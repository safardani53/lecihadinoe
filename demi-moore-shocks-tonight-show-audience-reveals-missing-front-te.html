"How did this happen?"</p><p>Fallon then held up a picture of Moore on her sofa at home.</p><p>At least we assume it was a picture of Moore.</p><p>One would be forgiven for being confused, considering the woman in the photograph was missing her front two teeth.</p><p>"I sheared off my front teeth," the 54-year old actress said simply.</p><p>Well, yes. That much is apparent.</p><p>But HOW?</p><p>"I’d love to say it was skateboarding or something really kind of cool, but I think I think it’s something that’s important to share, because I think it’s literally, probably after heart disease, one of the biggest killers in in America, which is stress," she explained, addingL:</p><p>"Stress sheared off my front teeth. But, in an effort to get ready for you, I wanted to make sure my teeth were in."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/demi-moore-with-no-teeth.jpg><p>Moore went on to say she really is missing "both" of her front teeth, although "the picture is only minus one."</p><p>The actress joked that her kids "love" her toothless appearance "because they think it makes me look more vulnerable and more human."</p><p>We guess we can understand that.</p><p>Demi Moore is one of the most beautiful actresses of all-time. That can be intimidating for anyone to encounter, even for her children.</p><p>In all seriousness, though, Moore dropped the stress-related PSA story and said she "literally knocked [the teeth] out" not very long ago.</p><p>"It was almost like it fell out and my warranty was up. I swear!" she said.</p><p>"Thank God for modern dentistry. All of you who go out and practice modern dentistry – thank God!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/demi-moore-on-the-tonight-show-1024x913.png><p>Moore proceeded to shared a video of herself acting all silly on Snapchat, explaining that it was filmed at her dentist’s office.</p><p>Drugs can be a wonderful thing, you know?</p><p>"People have a hard time at the dentist," she told the host, "And I think it can be a lot of fun."</p><p>Incredibly, this is the second time Moore has lost a tooth.</p><p>Way back in October of 2010, during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show – filmed while she was still married to Ashton Kutcher – Moore told a similar tale of what transpired.</p><p>"Thank God for modern dentistry," she said at that time as well, continuing:</p><p>"I had a bad bite and knocked my own front tooth out, which basically fell out into my hand, and I just thought my warranty was up. That was it.</p><p>"I called out and said, ‘Baby, my tooth has fallen out of my head.’"</p><p>At the time, Moore saids he was clenching her teeth and was "a little too tense" in hindsight.</p><p>"I was sitting at my desk and I felt something drop and I caught it and looked down, and there was my tooth."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>These things happen? We guess?</p><p>And when you’re Demi Moore, apparently they happen more than once.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WDcLDEpqBmpZ%2Bkv6Z50qGmnKOjYsGwusign61lo528uHnArpuinZ6Ysm6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrqqv9KipaBllqe8r8CMrZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZenBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
